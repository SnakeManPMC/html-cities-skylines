Transfer Manager CE by Sleepy. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804719780" target="_blank">steam link</a>.

<p>
Used transfer manager ce to setup this fire station only handle calls from PMC Industrial 1 district, to make sure they are there to take care of business when the need arises.

<p>
From <a href="stories-2022-08-27-the-eyeland.php">stories 2022-08-27 the eyeland</a>: <i>Was wondering why are our large warehouses full 750 tons of commercial zone goods and many of the commercial buildings are importing goods from outside connection, so I did "map wide" transfer manager ce config to disallow outside connect imports on "commercial type" buildings. Lets see if our warehouses and generic industry runs out of goods now, if it even works.</i>

<p>
Transfer Manager CE, options for general import, disabled for goods. Now lets see if this helps our commercial buildings to only use local source for goods products.
