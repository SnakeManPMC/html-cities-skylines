<p>
2022-09-05T02:59:00Z Started savegame on Icy Lands, all outside connections and natural resources, suitable area for building 59%, base theme: WINTER.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: 81 tiles, camera position utility, cinematic camera extended v0.5.1, csl show more limits, enhanced outside connections view, extended game options, extra landscaping tools, first person camera, harmony v2.2, hide it, lifecycle rebalance revisited v1.6.4, optimize outside connections, precision engineering, random tree rotation, realistic population 2 v2.0.5, rebalanced industries, roundabout builder, TM:PE stable v11.6.6.3, transfermanager ce v1.8.10, transporttool v2.3.1, ultimate level of detail, unlimited oil and ore, unlimited soil. List updated: 2022-08-27T21:39:00Z
</p>

<p>
Nothing more to say about WINTER terrains that was said in two previous stories... This is crappy looking terrain with a lot of water, rivers or bodies of water. Not so much elevations on the central areas, but it doesn't mean much as there is just stupid islands because of the rivers / water. Oh well, we'll get this to 100k population no problems.
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles for use. TM:PE enabled disable de-spawning, advanced vehicle AI enabled, 50% dynamic lane selection, parking AI enabled more realistic parking. Transfer manager ce, goods delivery options warehouse first, reserve trucks for local transfers 20%, improved inter-warehouse transfers, import/export disabled allow import goods, services prefer local district services, death care/garbage improved all three, general disable dummy traffic, vehicle AI enable garbage and police.
</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
First save game for Icy_Lands_1 file name.

2022-09-05T03:09:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.

I really hope to get this terrain savegame finished in extra quickly, I have zero interest playing in WINTER terrains, this is like pulling a teeth or working... uuh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

This milestone gave us airports, hmm was considering maybe I could learn / train with airports in this crappy WINTER terrain, but nah it just burns perfectly good population growing time from me, maybe another time. Hopefully some of the normal terrains I could play properly and do airport as well.

Mega mega.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T09:34:00Z Haven't been able to track hours, but this savegame seems like its progressing slowly, its been interesting to play but feels like its taking too long. Maybe I'm just imagening it dunno.
</p>

<p>
Honestly I was bored of growing the city, waiting for it to grow, so as one of our industrial areas had fertile land on it... I decided to create "zoned industry farming" there. While I wait. No big deal.
</p>

<p>
One progress screenshot before this savegame is done.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T1022.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T1022.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
For more boredom, decided to try this kind of looping one way road system around industrial area, in one side, out other side.
</p>

<p>
