	<h2>Stories 2022-08-13 Desert Oasis Game-play</h2>

<p>
2022-08-13T06:08:00Z Started savegame on Desert Oasis, all but ship outside connections, suitable area for building 76%, base theme: tropical.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: CargoHoldFix, ExtendedGameOptions, Harmony, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder, ShowIt.
</p>

<p>
Hmm desert terrain with some green on it too, hmm never seen such before, interesting change to the traditional green terrains. However this looks, well very boring, dunno why. Natural resources are there too, farmland, forest, oil, but... they look, odd, sparse hmm. Oh well, I'm going to do the systematic "math approach" for zoning where residential is in the middle, then commercial and industrial to avoid pollution. Trying to keep those areas small not to make some huge mega complexes.
</p>

<p>
Here is the starter setup before even unpausing the game, unless I forgot something now everything is in place.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T06:21:00Z First save game for Desert_Oasis_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
I'm using that 2x2 unit square grid setup to maximize growth in the beginning when using real population addon.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T06:31:00Z Little Hamlet population 500.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T06:37:00Z Worthy Village population 1k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T06:43:00Z Tiny Town population 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T06:54:00Z Boom Town population 2.8k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh. Activated parks and recreation policy.
</p>

<p>
Desert city is progressing nicely.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0706.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0706.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Ever growing city. Not bothering with the 2x2 unit squares anymore, just doing regular zone blocks, might take a bunch of landscape before reaching the high density milestone, still two to go.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0733.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0733.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T07:47:00Z Busy Town population 5.5k.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Desert_Oasis_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
Specialized industry, oil. Main building and all.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0755.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0755.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Desert_Oasis_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T09:04:00Z Playing around with oil specialized industry is, well harsh way to say it, waste of time, this savegames goal is to reach 100k population as fast as possible and oil or broad terms any other specialized industry is not going to do anything to achieve that goal.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I'm having fun lerning about oil stuff, but I bet this is the last time in the 100k population marathon that I'll be doing this, it really has no other point than to make money which I don't need and have "hobby" in the game, like the "industry stuff" dunno how to explain it. I mean simply it does nothing other than take input of your time and then output money into game, that's it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>

2022-08-13T09:33:00Z Saved game for Desert_Oasis_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.

<p>
2022-08-13T09:55:00Z Grand City population 22k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T10:06:00Z Feeding time is over, back to oil, I mean building our city.
</p>

<p>
Its always the same, when I go eat away from keyboard, something always happens, milestones kick in, fire breaks out, power goes out or issues with water etc <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T10:16:00Z Did some basic overhaul work to improve our citys services, added crematoriums, garbage incineration plant, advanced water treatment plant, big water towers, big improvement for fire department depots including helicopter depot. City should be much better overall now.
</p>

<p>
New zones, coming up! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Makes no sense for oil power plant to run out of oil, when its smack middle in the fucking OILFIELDS! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1050.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1050.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T10:56:00Z Capital City population 36k.
</p>

<p>
Cargo harbor is now available. But dunno if there are any water in this sand bowl <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
That oil power plant running out of fuel drove me crazy, had to ALT-TAB to google it maybe someone else has had the same issue. Well few people had the same issue, apparently its some traffic jam related thing, my traffic is very bad.
</p>

<p>
Had some electricity problems with those oil power plants, so added a few wind turbines ... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1116.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1116.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Ugh, lets get medieval with the powa <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

</p>

<p>
Cant wait for the next milestone when we get nuke plant and our power problems go away along with fossil fuel garbage like coal and oil.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T11:26:00Z Colossal City population 48k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
Power problems went away, finally <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T13:13:00Z Sort of tired, lack of motivation for this savegame. Now its just running and I'm hoping it by doing that would gain the remaining ten thousand for population. But dunno maybe I need to squeeze in some more residential areas.
</p>

<p>
Fire, by the nuke plant <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1315.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1315.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
And of course nuclear facility catches on fire, naturally! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1316.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1316.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Lucky for us fire department helicopter depot was stone throw away from the fire.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1317.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1317.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Had to create one more residential area, to push population to our goal.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1330.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1330.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T13:36:00Z Yeah! Population 100k, we have reached our goal, whohoo! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1336.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1336.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
As usual going to end playing here and archive this savegame until such time that I want to continue playing it. Goal was 100k population and it got done, heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T13:38:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, enough playing for today, cu.
