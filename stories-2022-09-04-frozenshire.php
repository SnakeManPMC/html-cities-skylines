	<h2>Stories 2022-09-04 Frozenshire Game-play</h2>

<p>
2022-09-04T10:58:00Z Started savegame on Frozenshire, all outside connections and natural resources, suitable area for building 51%, base theme: WINTER.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Please read Frosty Rivers game-play story first as I'm not going to repeat the same WINTER stuff here.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
What an horrible looking terrain, but maybe we can squeeze in 100k population out of this. Again very little screenshots in this story, I have zero interest screenshotting WINTER terrains.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T11:07:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
First save game for Frozenshire_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T11:16:00Z Little Hamlet population 440.
</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial. Purchased elementary school and landfill site.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I spoke too soon about "doable terrain", I'm running out of flat space already and only first milestone just achieved, I have to "poach" collector road space for buildings, but we'll who cares as this is winter terrain I'll bulldoze stuff when I got more money.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T11:23:00Z Worthy Village population 850.
</p>

<p>
Did not create districts as they have no use in this savegame. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Frozenshire_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T11:25:00Z Restored electric budget to 100% but roads, water and education is still 50% or "low".
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T11:30:00Z Tiny Town population 1.3k.
</p>

<p>
Replaced placeholder dirt road arterial and collectors with a simple small industrial road, will fix arterial and collector later. Replaced industrial areas roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Frozenshire_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T11:42:00Z Restored all budgest to 100% which is the normal. Enough playing poor dude.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T11:44:00Z Boom Town population 2.4k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T12:04:00Z Busy Town population 4.4k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers. Two lane road with trees, this is my go-to local road, will NOT start using it now because winter terrain.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Frozenshire_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T12:13:00Z Now I have reached the first long waiting phase, got pretty decent chunk of road grid and low density residential zoning done, not much to do other than wait for the next milestone.
</p>

<p>
This city is the fucking ugliest city in the planet <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I might have to take my words back about "this terrain should be doable for 100k population..." because yes there are empty space a bit further out, but its not even connected to the same highway. Sure I can do my own, but... well it just shows you how shitty terrain this WINTER one is. Huge ass mountains which would not fit even in ArmA 3 even though it can use pretty wild mountains, rivers everywhere and yup, do I need to say more.
</p>

<p>
Oh well, lets get to 100k population and be done with this crap. I sure as hell never going to play this terrain savegame ever again.
</p>

<p>
Okay one screenshot.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Was just thinking a while how much there is waiting in Cities Skylines, its kind of like Farming Simulator when you have Courseplay working on a big field or even you drive using GPS, a lot of waiting on those long passes. Seems like ArmA 3 is the only game I play which has no downtime.
</p>

<p>
Decided that instead of waiting I'll be pro-active, going to create another "community neighborhood" little further out in this same highway connection, creating cloverleaf intersection and build residential on one and industrial on the other side.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T12:32:00Z Big Town population 6.5k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant, intercity bus, university and large warehouse are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T12:33:00Z Now its time to cook food and eat, again. Two food groups, yup, cooking time.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T13:19:00Z Feeding time is over, back to WINTER crap.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T13:34:00Z Small City population 9k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train terminal, train station (passengers!) and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
Created both of those train buildings and connected to outside connection railroad network.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T14:07:00Z Big City population 14k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T14:57:00Z Grand City population 18k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T15:33:00Z Capital City population 28k.
</p>

<p>
Passenger and cargo harbor is now available, passenger is a must have for incoming citizens.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T16:33:00Z Colossal City population 38k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T17:25:00Z Metropolis population 55k.
</p>

<p>
Hmm not much story telling here hehe. Well got into trouble with traffic, too many industrial and commercial buildings, zoned them too fast and roads got hammered. Been adding pretty nice amount of high density residential zoning and several good metro tracks, few bus lines too.
</p>

<p>
Dunno what else to say, just trying to finish this savegame as fast as possible. Its now about half way through but at this point if everything goes OK (if, hah) progress is pretty fast with high density residential zoning.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-04T1728.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-04T1728.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T18:05:00Z Megalopolis population 70k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-04T18:10:00Z Alarm for being awake 17hrs went off some time ago, getting pretty tired several tens of thousands of population to grow before this would be done, so now its finally time to call it a night.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T01:17:00Z New Cities Skylines building day has started. Just woke up and finished morning computer chores, have not eaten days first meal yet, going to get savegame loaded and running in 3x time acceleration speed because time is what we need now, city has everything going and just by waiting it can gain several thousand citizens alone.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T01:37:00Z Zoned some more high density residential. Saved game and will let it run on 3x speed while I go grab a days first meal <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T02:08:00Z Feeding time is over, back to city building. Oh nice city grew to 94.9k population while I was eating, good good. Not much more to go.
</p>

<p>
Very unhealthy city, traffic flow 22% heh. Crematoriums hearses are distributed nicely to every area, not district as I didn't use them, but they are in all areas, however they do not work properly because I see many skulls and bones icons in the horizon, makes no sense. Guess Transfer Manager CE is not working exactly, so dunno if I want to revisit my decision to not use districts and limit services to localized areas only. Oh well we are almost at our goal, maybe in the next savegame.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T02:25:00Z Citys unhealthyness continues, we are at 95k population so its that close to our goal so I thought we could just swing it and leave nasty stinking pile of a mess savegame behind, but this last 5k population will be a struggle as city is in such a bad shape. Pisses me off that hearses arent doing their job LOCALIZED as they should be. Yes of course its the traffic gridlock to blame overall, but still why does hearses be sent to other side of the city to get caught in any traffic in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, lets just try to swing it...
</p>

<p>
Zoned some office blocks, that hopefully entices our high density residential zoning to get some buildings up. This is now the last push to get us to our goal... so close! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T0231.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T0231.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T02:36:00Z Come on you filthy nasty stinkhole of a city, only a bit over 3k citizens to go! You can do it! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I will never return to these shit WINTER terrains, but having said that, this savegame would be good project to fix with the massive traffic problem which lead to services not working and buildings getting abandoned etc, whole bucket load of problems. But yeah never return to WINTER terrain, there is plenty of other normal nice ones to play.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T02:40:00Z Created last few road grids and zoned high density residential, this will get us there...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T02:43:00Z Uah finally! We have reached our goal, 100k population! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T0243.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T0243.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T02:44:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, so happy to get another shit WINTER terrain finished.
