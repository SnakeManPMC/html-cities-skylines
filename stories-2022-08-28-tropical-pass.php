<p>
2022-08-28T08:20:00Z Started savegame on Tropical Pass, all outside connections and natural resources, suitable area for building 68%, base theme: tropical.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: 81 tiles, camera position utility, cinematic camera extended v0.5.1, csl show more limits, enhanced outside connections view, extended game options, extra landscaping tools, first person camera, harmony v2.2, hide it, lifecycle rebalance revisited v1.6.4, optimize outside connections, precision engineering, random tree rotation, realistic population 2 v2.0.5, rebalanced industries, roundabout builder, TM:PE stable v11.6.6.3, transfermanager ce v1.8.10, transporttool v2.3.1, ultimate level of detail, unlimited oil and ore, unlimited soil. List updated: 2022-08-27T21:39:00Z
</p>

<p>
Just finished previous savegame but still had few hours left in tonight so decided to start a new terrain savegame. No specific plan on this one, just try to avoid traffic jams and grow that population fast. I'm going to configure transfer manager ce so we wont take any outside connection imports, gotta be self sustaining <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Uuh what a horrible looking terrain is this again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles for use. I want freedom. Then configured TM:PE gameplay advanced vehicle AI on, dynamic lane selection 50%, parking AI enable more realistic parking. Then transfer manager ce, warehouse first with reserve trucks for local transfers 20%, improved inter-warehouse transfer, import/export disabled "goods", services prefer local district services, improved: death care, garbage and police, vehicle AI enabled all.
</p>

<p>
Set budget for roads, electricity and water to 50% for money saving.
</p>

<p>
Starting setup, dunno what monstrosity that terrain built in interchange is but ugh.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T08:33:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
First save game for Tropical_Pass_1 file name.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial.
</p>

<p>
TM:PE turned off vehicle de-spawning.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T08:57:00Z Worthy Village population 1k.
</p>

<p>
Created my first districts for PMC Residential 1, PMC Industrial 1 and PMC Commercial 1. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Tropical_Pass_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T09:08:00Z Tiny Town population 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
Replaced PMC Industrial 1 district roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Placed warehouse yard to PMC Industrial 1 district, set it to commercial goods and named it PMC Goods WH 1. Placed first high school using "institute of creative arts" with student capacity 2349. Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Tropical_Pass_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
Uuh this sucks, such a terrible starting location and the other highway ends didn't look that good either. How do I make arterial road here when there is basically no room for collector heh. Oh well.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0940.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0940.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Tropical_Pass_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T10:59:00Z Zzz... nothing happening, have zoned plenty of low density residential but nothing, no progress, just feels like everything is stalled. Guess its progressing, just so slow I'm bored to death. Luckily its my bed time already, can shut this down at any moment, but still would like to get a bit more progress.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T11:08:00Z Big Town population 7k.

However with that... I'm off to sleep, getting really tired and don't have energy to start doing this milestones big changes. More tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T11:10:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, good night.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T17:46:00Z New Cities Skylines day has started, just woke up, did computer chores and got caught by some stupid google gmail password crap, gave up on that stupidity, its time for Cities Skylines. Need to get some city building time before days first meal <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Goodness gracious this terrain is such shit, eeww, the sooner I get this savegame pushed to 100k population the better, I want to move on to a better terrain savegames where I'm actually enjoying the game-play <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T18:07:00Z Small City population 9.5k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train station and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T18:31:00Z Got a little crazy with terrain heightmap editing tools, leveled most of the place to 60m elevation hehe. Huge flooding, mayhem, uuh aah! And now I'm off to eat days first meal, lets see if the city is still standing when I came back <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T19:00:00Z Feeding time is over, is the flood done yet?
</p>

<p>
Flooding went away, water is back on its place, however city is in a shambles, so many abandoned houses icons pulsating in the horizon. We do have decent amount of population and things seem to run, I see few garbage bin icons in the furthest part of the city but that is normal. I placed police headquarters on the center as there was many crime icons, those went away real quick.
</p>

<p>
Alright lets start to re-build this city and get to 100k population as fast as possible <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
New highway intersection, lets try to rebuild this bitch of a terrain to meet our goal.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T1914.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T1914.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Let me spread my motherfucking wings! Muhahaha! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T1932.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T1932.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Yeah I need my freedom, you can take my freedom... from my cold dead hands.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T19:37:00Z Big City population 15k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T19:53:00Z Grand City population 18k.
</p>

<p>
Created PMC Oil 1 and PMC Ore 1 industrial districts (zoned industry, no main building industries DLC stuff).
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T20:33:00Z Again our industry runs into "not enough buyers for products" and then "no buyers for products" issue, for example in PMC Oil 1 district... umm err, I'm not exactly sure how it happens, but oil drills/pumps extract oil and send it to processor buildings, so either processor buildings cannot sell "oil products" fast enough OR oil pumps extract raw materials too fast. However this theory goes out the window because I found one processor building which was abandoned because "building is abandoned because there were no raw materials", umm okay so pumps could not keep up then, how is that possible, hmph!? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Demented traffic.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2045.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2045.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Wonder how long it will take to sort out all that mess. Opened firefox browser into right side monitor and will start to browse some Cities Skylines info for boredom while I wait for that 24% traffic flow nastiness to dissipate overtime.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T20:56:00Z Capital City population 28k.
</p>

<p>
Cargo harbor is now available. Created one of these right away, to get the load off from our roads.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2103.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2103.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
And then cargo train terminal connecting into the harbor. This is our nearest and biggest industrial area right now.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2108.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2108.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
All that should help on the traffic for sure.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T21:40:00Z Colossal City population 38k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
Created passenger train station so new citizens can get close to the residential zone.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2200.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T2200.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T22:18:00Z Well shut down firefox in side monitor, enough reading more playing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T22:31:00Z Metropolis population 55k.
</p>

<p>
Traffic jam is so bad that the line forms all the way to terrain edge, wow. Okay decided to clear vehicles using TM:PE, I mean what do I got to lose?
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T23:16:00Z Megalopolis population 70k.
</p>

<p>
Whee last milestone reached. I'm busy setting up train tracks heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T23:27:00Z Saved game and now I'm off to grab a bite to eat while game runs in 3x time acceleration speed.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T23:55:00Z Feeding time is over, is the city still alive? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T00:56:00Z Been doing all sorts of tinkering, basically that TM:PE clear vehicles saved the day, there has been some slow flow traffic since the clear but nothing like the gridlock back then. Been adding some office zones but right now started to get not enough educated workers again.
</p>

<p>
Problem, I don't have a garbage problem? Do you see me having a garbage problem? Maybe its YOUR problem?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T01:40:00Z Was just sitting back, waiting and watching population number slowly increase, hoping it would get to our goal number soon, but its slow going due bad traffic flow and related issues.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T02:06:00Z Uaah! It is done, 100k population, yes! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-29T0206.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-29T0206.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Alright as it should be pretty obvious from the mood in the text before, I'm absolutely going to call it here and just relax rest of the evening, I highly doubt would be starting another terrains savegame tonight, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T02:08:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, we are outta here.
