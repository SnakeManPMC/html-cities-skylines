	<h2>Stories 2022-08-07 Cliffside Bay</h2>

<p>
2022-08-07T05:01:00Z Started savegame on Cliffside Bay, all outside connections, suitable area for building 53%.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Only mod used is Extended Game Options.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T05:17:00Z Little Hamlet population 400.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T05:21:00Z Worthy Village population 800.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T05:26:00Z Tiny Town population 1.3k.
</p>

<p>
In this terrain I'm trying this kind of mixed RCI zoning, it doesn't feel natural to me but hey lets give it a try anyways, at least if I'm ridiculing the guide then I known what I'm talking about heh.
</p>

<p>
Yeah I can already tell from the second row that this aint gonna work in the long run...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0541.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0541.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I need to go read that guide/tutorial again to see if I missed something because as I see this now, umm err for each industrial block you get two commercial buffer blocks. Well I guess it depends on your point of view, from left to right its; industrial pollution, commercial buffer barrier and then residential block. Anyways I'll figure it out but as of like this, yeah this is fucking stupid.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T05:56:00Z Boom Town population 2.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T06:27:00Z Busy Town population 4.2k.
</p>

<p>
Oh my, if this is technically the correct way to play Cities Skylines, then I don't wanna any part of it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T06:44:00Z Big Town population 6.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T06:53:00Z Small City population 8.5k.
</p>

<p>
Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
Uuh..
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0705.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0705.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Feels so wrong heh. Traffic starts to clogg up by the highway connection again, so dunno what to make of it, city grows and yeah putting R-C-I-C-R loop zones helps for THAT vehicle problem, but it doesn't remove the core problem which is highway connection to the city. Hmm. This savegame feels like a dead end already, but still glad I tried it out, to get some real experience.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T07:10:00Z Did first savegame to Cliffside_Bay_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
Going to pause and ALT-TAB for a moment, I want to re-read that guide if I'm doing it right or not, this feels so stupid I would never play like this on my own as it creates just TECHNICALLY good city but which doesn't look anything like in real life.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T07:13:00Z Had to exit Cities Skylines to desktop because it lags my computer especially when doing something graphical like watching videos, it also lags other programs like text editor but its not that noticeable luckily. Its weird how it does that even when paused with ESC menu.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T07:57:00Z Alright did enough research, well I was sligthly wrong with the design, you can do big blob of residential zone with commercial on the outskirt and after that industrial, that way pollution is buffered from residential buildings. This now makes much more sense as you can have large set of residential buildings and only little commercial and industrial. So yeah guess I was a bit off with my initial long strips seen above heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T08:12:00Z Okay Cities Skylines back up and I did a new design.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0812.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0812.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-07T08:13:00Z Big City population 14k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T08:21:00Z Grand City population 17k.
</p>

<p>
Saved game to Cliffside_Bay_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
Upgrading dirt roads to asphalt is a fucking pain, uuh, it almost feels like you should not expand your city if its not with asphalt roads as its so painful task to upgrade. Takes forever to click through all those roads.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T08:42:00Z Uuh roads upgraded... I hereby solemly swear that I will never ever upgrade dirt roads to asphalt anymore when they are done in such great numbers!
</p>

<p>
As soon as initial city has been built I'll switch to use asphalt roads so I don't have to upgrade. The asphalt roads are available in savegame start but they are much more expensive than dirt so in the initial poor cheapo start its good to make few city blocks with dirt roads, but as soon as the city starts to grow, switch to asphalt roads, fuck upgrading, no more, never.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T08:57:00Z Another area is complete, we need some residential, fast heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0857.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0857.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Not sure why but this design feels so gay, so spoon fed forced, "scientific" somehow, technical, disgusting, ugh, this is like chess board crap, I really <i>really</i> do not like it.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0901.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0901.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Also it takes forever to make those 5 unit road grids and then flag those zones, when I make my big residentical districts yes it takes a while to draw the roads but doing zones after that is pretty much "flag all and done" heh, well not exactly but pretty close.
</p>

<p>
This has been (will be?) a fun test but I will never do this kind of city design anymore, it has to be natural realistic city I don't care about traffic jams and stuff, I don't do this for the technical expertise and efficiency, I do to create real life city as close as possible. Sure my cities look like a child threw some crayons on the wall until marks appeared, but still at least there is a resemblance of realistic places, instead of this stupid math designed tech horror show.
</p>

<p>
Most of the commercial and industrial zones havent built up yet, but yeah. It kind of looks freaky heh dunno how to explain.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0906.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0906.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Saved game to Cliffside_Bay_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
And another math wizard hideous thing is ready. Wonder if those single 4 x 4 unit industrial and commercial is enough to satisfy all those folks, hmm, interesting to find out.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0925.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0925.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Hmm well this is interesting, why does this guy get polluted ground nausea status? Is that one 4 x 4 unit zone enough buffer zone from a factory?
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0931.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0931.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Buffer from polluting industrial building needs at least two 4 x 4 units or well rather 8 units in more direct terminology.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0939.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T0939.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
This was valuable experience gained by that, sure I sort-of-knew that before, but now I have hard screenshots facts to back it up, I usually don't place residential buildings this close to polluting nasty crap holes.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T09:40:00Z Capital City population 28k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T09:51:00Z Okay changed the three commercial zones with 8 x 4 unit setup, should be enough buffer size now.
</p>

<p>
Saved game to Cliffside_Bay_4 file name which is now last of the rotating four file names.
</p>

<p>
Then destroyed zoning on the "old town" area where we started, setup it correctly with 8 unit commercial zones. This of course wrecks havoc for our population and everything, hopefully it settles down soon.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T10:19:00Z Colossal City population 36k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T10:24:00Z Its my lunch break, saved game just in case and I let it run while eating.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T10:52:00Z Feeding time is over, back to building this crappy city.
</p>

<p>
Now I want to reach our goal really fast, this savegame puts me off.
</p>

<p>
Next I deleted all the commercial zones from the second huge long strip of err areas. Now it looks really funky.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1100.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1100.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Another terrible setup created, ugh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1130.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1130.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-07T12:01:00Z Metropolis population 55k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T12:16:00Z Megalopolis population 65k.
</p>

<p>
All milestones achieved, nice. Now we can buy all the terrain grid tiles and focus on final goal <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now I own it all <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T13:43:00Z Now game-play is kind of stalled, population slowly increases and RCI info bars are active, but residential demand is 0% so dunno if I dare to create new horror blocks.
</p>

<p>
Population now 86.7k so not bad, with luck I could finish this savegame today.
</p>

<p>
Gimme some more! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1353.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1353.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
And more industrial stuff.
</p>

<p>
Cargo train terminal is sure keeping busy, especially those roads, heh what a death trap <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-07T14:56:00Z That's it, its a wrap! 100,000 population <img src="../images/smileys/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Smiley :mrgreen:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1456.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-07T1456.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, another terrain savegame 100k population in the bag. Aayeah! Still have a bit time left today, I get to do few computer chores before bed time, awesome <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
