</p>

	<h2>2022-07-28 Roads, Where, Huh</h2>

<p>
2022-07-28T16:21:00Z New city building day has started, going to continue this road learning savegame which got out of hand, this has nothing to do about learning roads anymore this just somehow got blown out of proportion to normal savegame heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T16:32:00Z colossal city pop 55k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T16:56:00Z I'm starving', time for the days first meal.
</p>

<p>
While eating I was feeling not exactly frustrated but bored I guess of Cities Skylines again, its the same old read as its always ween, once city grows too big you lose all touch in reality so to speak, it gets out of hand, you just spawn more and more zones in never ending loop. Then its all the problems with <a href="garbage.php">Garbage</a> and buggy <a href="death-wave.php">Death Wave</a> etc... its simply frustrating and dumb feeling.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that it could be that I'll go back to <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/" target="_blank">ArmA 3</a> editing or <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org" target="_blank">Farming Simulator 19</a> playing today, we'll see how today starts off with ...
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T17:27:00Z Feeding time over, back to building a city.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I think my overall problem with Cities Skylines is that I pack everything wall-to-wall tight where any piece of property without buildings feels like bad design, so I end up with these huge claustrophobic polluted metropolis cities where you cant even see roads at quick glance.
</p>

<p>
My brain wont accept such sloppy design where you have stupid parks and big open spaces for highways or other large roads and roundabouts. I just cant think like that no matter how hard I try.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps its me being terrain maker and knowing these Cities Skylines terrains are piece of shit tiny. I mean sure they are like little girlie men ArmA 3 terrain sizes maybe 5km x 5km or so, but still, that is tiny. But making a huge city with highway roundabouts or cloverleaf intersections, train tracks etc... it just doesn't feel like something you could do in such tiny size.
</p>

<p>
Also I seem to design city in sections, for example in this road learning savegame I have a sneaking river which I crossed with two lane asphalt road (two of them) and then on the other side of the river landmass I created megalopolis high density residential wall-to-wall packed section of city. You know what that means, the two roads leading up to it are a huge bottle neck for traffic. Sure I have metro and bus line, but those can only do so much.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Currently my city design has problem with the ore 1 district, there is (or was hmm?) lack of educated workers (high school) and as I'm typing this "<a href="not-enough-raw-materials.php">Not Enough Raw Materials</a>", meaning outside connections are not working. Outside connection for road is problematic sure, its one of my best so far but yes its not working efficiently, however I have a fucking TRAIN CARGO HUB right in the smack dead center of ore 1 district, how the fuck are you lacking raw materials if you have train loads of it thrown at you every 30 seconds?
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T18:33:00Z Looked at natural resources screen and I was shocked to see ALL my specialized industry had depleted oil and ore natural resources! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Err that cant be, this quickly? What fucking sense is there to use this thing if it eats through natural resources that quickly?
</p>

<p>
So I changed the specialized industry back to general industry.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T18:37:00Z That demolished all the industry buildings in these two districts, nothing happened in the "<a href="rci.php">RCI</a>" info bars. First new generic industry building is being constructed now. Really interesting to see what happens next, even though end result is extremely disappointing that natural resources deplete so fucking quickly.
</p>

<p>
Generic industry buildings are popping up really slowly. While waiting I checked natural resources if it had increased or are they gone for good. Currently oil 556,968 units, ore 749,924 units, forest 81,082 units/week and fertile land 287 ha.
</p>

<p>
Forest and fertile land has used changing, forest 1905 units/week and fertile land 6 ha.
</p>

<p>
While typing this and monitoring those numbers, seems like oil and ore is not replenishing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<i>
Forestry and farming are renewable resources, which will continue to produce raw materials indefinitely. Planting trees will replace fertile land with forestry, and the fertile land will be removed permanently.
</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>
Oil and ore extraction however consumes the resource, eventually depleting it entirely. Once this occurs, the production buildings will complain of a lack of natural resources and eventually will become abandoned if not able to import said resources. If you don't remove the specialization from the zone, these buildings will be replaced with specialized secondary industry facilities. This can be quite a shock for your transportation system and supply chain, as a zone which previously supplied raw material will transform into one that needs to import it.
</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>
The game has a built-in mod "Unlimited Oil and Ore - oil and ore are not reduced from terrain"[1], which prevents them from being depleted. It must be activated before the resource is gone, as it only halts depletion, and will not renew it. Note that this will disable Achievements, unless they are re-enabled by a mod from the workshop.

<p>
Well that sucks <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Frustration level increases... mind wanders to ArmA 3 mission editing...
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T19:30:00Z Created cargo and passenger train stations to umm err W side of big residential zones where high density commercial zones were out of goods to sell, hopefully the train imports will make that issue go away.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T19:53:00Z Got that train setup working pretty good, had to add metro subway station as there was so much people getting off the passenger trains, it was less than hundred guys per week I believe but still it looked a like bunch of folks in 3D world.
</p>

<p>
It was fascinating to get that passenger train + metro + bus line working together. This is the aspect I love about Cities Skylines, when everything just fits together.
</p>

<p>
Of course when I zoomed out my cargo train was unloading a lot of products and that completely clogged up the main road towards my residential and commercial zones hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T20:11:00Z metropolis pop 70k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T22:33:00Z megalopolis pop 95k.
</p>

<p>
And now, its my lunch break... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-28T23:01:00Z Feeding time over, back to city building.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T01:27:00Z Hmm current population 136k and the river is running out of water, upstream dried up, I put "a few" water intake pumps there and ZOC! it dries up, no more water. On the other hand city is pushing out so fucking much of sewage that its not even funny, I created a flash flood when I changed the sewage pump location to different river downstream.
</p>

<p>
Not sure what to do anymore, we are shit out of luck if we don't have enough water. I tried the water saving policy but that cost 5eur per household and that made my revenue to negative heh.
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning: "Farmland Flats" terrain</b> might have some water source issue, just remember that before starting a new save on it.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T02:26:00Z The city is quite packed right now, yes there is still four tiles left to build I think, but I am already a bit exhausted of doing roads and setting everything up so nicely etc. I'm just watching the city and, well, dunno what exactly... probably going to start a new city or try to fix the previous one I did earlier yesterday, but somehow I feel like Cities Skylines has really ran its course for me now. Dunno, just feel a bit exhausted.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T02:41:00Z Yup I'm bored and exhausted for this savegame, my mind wanders to larger terrains, there is some mods for that but I really don't want to start fiddling with mods because Cities Skylines is such a nice relaxing game where you simply start it up and then click with a mouse and be done with it, no need to dig deep into addons and techniques etc. I am already playing ArmA 3, Farming Simulator 19 and <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.net" target="_blank">Elite Dangerous</a>, plus occasional <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/cold-waters/" target="_blank">Cold Waters</a> / <a href="https://www.silenthunter.info" target="_blank">Silent Hunter 5</a>, so I really don't want to get deep into one more game. Kind of funny to say that after soon been playing 2 days straight 18hrs/day hehe.
</p>

<p>
Googled the "81 tiles mod", several pages include its own home page (steam shitshop) says that game is limited to 9 tiles by default because performance issues and even when 81 tiles are available you cannot build your city to megalodon size, it doesnt work as the game is such piece of shit conzole crap. So yes its kind of like ofp/arma "600km terrain!!!" yes we can do it with some silly CellSize, but I would not want to play on such terrain due technical limitations.
</p>

<p>
So forget 81 tiles mod, in a long run its not worth it.
</p>

<p>
Also I really really don't want to dig deep into downloading mods (steamcmd and all that stupid shit), I just want to play some "RTS alike" mouse clicking fun without thinking too much, if I want to think I'll play my regular simulators <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T03:12:00Z Saved game "snake03" which is farmland flats with population of 133k.
</p>

<p>
Exited cities skyline, no not going to quit but need to create new savegame and try something, so good to have a full reset.
