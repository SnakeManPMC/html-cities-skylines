	<h2>Stories 2022-08-12 Wolf Creek Game-play</h2>

<p>
2022-08-12T12:35:00Z Started savegame on Wolf Creek, all outside connections but ship, suitable area for building 60%, base theme: boreal.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: CargoHoldFix, ExtendedGameOptions, Harmony, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder, ShowIt.
</p>

<p>
This is the initial setup before even unpausing the game. Not the greatest but it will have to do now.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1244.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1244.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
First save game for Wolf_Creek_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
Forgot power line to the sewage pipe <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This time I wont be doing those 1x1 or 2x2 low density residential zoning blocks, just regular stuff as seen above.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T12:50:00Z Little Hamlet population 500.
</p>

<p>
Was just about to take damage from lack of power and water heh. Problem was that industrial started placing buildings from the south end where I didn't have neither. Okay sure I could have prevented this by only zoning where I want stuff to be placed, and yeah I'll correct my mistake for the next time. But yeah. Milestone saved my ass <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1251.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1251.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T12:57:00Z Worthy Village population 1k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T13:02:00Z Tiny Town population 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
Activated parks and recreation policy even though we don't have any yet.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T13:19:00Z Boom Town population 2.6k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T13:22:00Z Save game for Wolf_Creek_2 file name. And then it was my lunch time...
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T13:46:00Z Feeding time is over, back to building a city. Was actually surprised next milestone did not trigger yet.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T13:55:00Z Busy Town population 5.5k.
</p>

<p>
Created PMC Farmland 1 specialized industry area, with the main building etc placeable stuff. Dunno why, just wanted to do some of that stuff in this savegame.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1401.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1401.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Then created PMC Forestry 1 same as above but just for forest stuff.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1405.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1405.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Actually now I want to do ore and oil too, but lets see if we have those natural resources anywhere nearby.
</p>

<p>
Forestry is working hard, good good.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1408.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1408.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Same for farmland, lets get some raw materials done.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1409.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1409.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T14:25:00Z Perfect, just what we need right now, fire department, where the hell are ya!? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1425.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1425.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T14:51:00Z Save game for Wolf_Creek_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T14:58:00Z Big Town population 7.5k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant and university are now available. Alright now we start cooking <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Current progress. Just added first high density residential and office zones. Now we hopefully start to see some good population growth.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1506.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1506.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T15:19:00Z This is my very first time trying UNIQUE FACTORIES in Cities Skylines. I got to admit did not even see the "garbage" icon had tabs for unique factories heh, blind man in action here. No big deal, better late than never heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1519.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1519.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Now my question is; for what? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I mean what does unique factory bakery do, yes it takes animal products, crops and flour, then outputs pastries... Right, OK, so? So what am I going to do with pastries? Or is it just a virtual thing in this game universe that pastries == money income? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm, would be quite lame if its just virtual thing that this building simply makes good money, umm I don't need money I get all the money I need from city taxes, this kind of factory if its has no other use than to make money, I'm not sure there is any point using them. Hmm hmm...
</p>

<p>
Oh and unique factory as in only single one of those buildings can be placed in a savegame. Gotcha.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T15:25:00Z Saved game for Wolf_Creek_4 file name which is now the fourth and last on in this file name rotation.
</p>

<p>
Ah I see, it seems to make silly money, it just started producing and already 3.8k, not sure in which time frame that 3.8k clicks to your budget but yeah should be good money (that I don't need).
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1527.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1527.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Purchased unique factory: furniture.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1538.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1538.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T15:38:00Z Small City population 11k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train station and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T15:58:00Z Big City population 16k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
Been so excited and busy adding farming and forestry stuff, that completely missed... this <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1606.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1606.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Ouch man, that is some bad traffic gridlock right there! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Forestry industry equipment is on FIRE! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1613.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1613.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T16:21:00Z Grand City population 20k.
</p>

<p>
Another update time. Still struggling with the traffic but otherwise improving and enlarging locations a lot. Seems like our forestry produces so much "raw forestry products" that saw mills etc cannot process them into timber and paper fast enough.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1656.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1656.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T16:59:00Z I realized that this specialized industry with main buildings stuff is very, while exciting, its also stressful, kind of difficult to explain, but you are limited by space so you try to maximize the coverage where you can "extract" material, and then like now you have traffic issues when you get so much of said material that your roads are filled with trucks back to back hauling that stuff out. Right now my export is 10k with most agricultural and forestry.
</p>

<p>
Like these guys, large semi-truck's "18 wheelers" hauling "raw forestry products" to export, outside connection. So these trucks must travel through my chocked up roundabout area, yikes <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1704.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1704.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Then it was time to store our crops, bought a few farm bin silos <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1711.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1711.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Reminds me of Farming Simulator <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T17:24:00Z Alarm went off that I've been up 17hrs, pfft, we continue... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Cargo train terminal, this either makes our traffic better... or worse hehe.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1727.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1727.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Right away a huge armada of forestry semi-truck's started to pour in from that district heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1728.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1728.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T17:40:00Z Capital City population 32k.
</p>

<p>
Cargo harbor is now available.
</p>

<p>
Oh my, what is this madness? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1752.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1752.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Now that's TiGHT! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1757.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1757.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T18:41:00Z Colossal City population 44k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
Our farm and NUKE plant is on fire! Yikes! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1857.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1857.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Fire engines on scene!
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1900.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1900.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Our farm is toast <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1901.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1901.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Noo! collapse!
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1902.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1902.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Two farm bin silos burned down, lost 328 + 320 tons of crops <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1907.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1907.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Okay its time to take a last look of our city for tonight, starting to get tired, don't have more motivational mental energy to work on the city tonight.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1909.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T1909.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T19:11:00Z Saved game, shut down Cities Skylines, its my bed time, nites.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T03:26:00Z New Cities Skylines day has started, just woke up and finished morning chores, lets continue this savegame, we have a goal to reach. But first milestones and that traffic should be resolved heh.
</p>

<p>
Had to do some emergency alike garbage collecting work in SE corner of our city, our only other garbage facilities are in NW corner locked behind gridlocked traffic. I really don't like incineration plants this close to the city and in the middle of beautiful conifer tree forest, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0337.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0337.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Unbelievable, our farms is on fire, AGAIN <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0343.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0343.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Created a whole fire station to our farming and forest industry area, hopefully it manages to take care of fires.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0345.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0345.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-13T03:50:00Z Metropolis population 65k.
</p>

<p>
New six lane main arterial road created through and almost around the city.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0405.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0405.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Central area. Too bad view distance prevents us seeing the whole vehicle flow on the roads.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0406.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0406.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Dreaded roundabout area in the distance. Hopefully this road improves traffic flow at least a bit.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0407.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0407.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-13T04:25:00Z Saved game and let it run on 3x time acceleration speed while I go eat days first meal. Lets hope nothing breaks. But just as I was leaving...
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T04:27:00Z Megalopolis population 80k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T04:53:00Z Feeding time is over, back to our city.
</p>

<p>
City has seem to settle down quite nicely with time, not much residential demand but industrial is up at 40% or so. Population 96.9k. Things are looking good.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T05:06:00Z Aayeah! Population 100k! We have reached our terrain savegame goal! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0506.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T0506.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I was in the middle of building this city SE corner, roads and services etc setup, all it takes is one block at the time to zone it and wait for stuff to build... but nah, I'll call it a day for this savegame now, next terrain awaits <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T05:08:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, off to the next one.
