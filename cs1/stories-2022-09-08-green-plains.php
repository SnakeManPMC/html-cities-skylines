<p>
2022-09-08T10:32:00Z Started savegame on Green Plains, all outside connections and natural resources, suitable area for building 74%, base theme: boreal.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: 81 tiles, camera position utility, cinematic camera extended v0.5.1, csl show more limits, enhanced outside connections view, extended game options, extra landscaping tools, first person camera, harmony v2.2, hide it, lifecycle rebalance revisited v1.6.4, optimize outside connections, precision engineering, random tree rotation, realistic population 2 v2.0.5, rebalanced industries, roundabout builder, TM:PE stable v11.6.6.3, transfermanager ce v1.8.10, transporttool v2.3.1, ultimate level of detail, unlimited oil and ore, unlimited soil. List updated: 2022-08-27T21:39:00Z
</p>

<p>
Ah boreal base theme (looks nice spruce / pine forest, right?) and good looking buildings, I like this one. On the terrain selector list there was still several left, but cautiously I'm thinking that next week this mega terrain savegame game-play marathon is over.
</p>

<p>
Bunch of rivers in this terrain too, why cant there be a simple flat and landlocked terrain with small water source on the side, is that so hard to do? Apparently it is.
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles for use. TM:PE enabled disable de-spawning, advanced vehicle AI enabled, 50% dynamic lane selection, parking AI enabled more realistic parking. Transfer manager ce, goods delivery options warehouse first, reserve trucks for local transfers 20%, improved inter-warehouse transfers, import/export disabled allow import goods, services prefer local district services, death care/garbage improved all three, general disable dummy traffic, vehicle AI enable garbage and police.
</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
First save game for Green_Plains_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T10:42:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
I made a mistake in my highway outside connection road linking, there was a missing piece so the connection was broken. I setup everything else just nice as seen on the screenshot, then unpaused and low density residential buildings started to come up. So buildings come up even though there is no physical way of people to get into the building or the whole city for that matter. Interesting.
</p>

<p>
Also kind of fake, in low residential neighborhood you heard "life sounds" even though there was 0 people present <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But, no need to pick on the little things hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T10:53:00Z Little Hamlet population 500.
</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial. Purchased elementary school and landfill site.
</p>

<p>
I kind of miss the industries DLC way of doing industrial stuff, but its way too time consuming to play with those as my goal is to just get 100k population as fast as possible. Last time I played with industries DLC it got out of hand and took hours just tinkering with those toys heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T11:03:00Z Worthy Village population 1k.
</p>

<p>
Didn't create districts this time either. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Green_Plains_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T11:10:00Z Tiny Town population 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
Replaced placeholder dirt road arterial and collectors with proper six and four lane asphalt roads. Replaced industrial areas roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Green_Plains_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T11:26:00Z Restored budget to 100% which is the normal.
</p>

<p>
A little bit traffic on industrial commercial area, need to wait until public transport is available so can create bus lines at which point I'll ban all private cars in that area, that will take care of any traffic issues.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T11:31:00Z Boom Town population 2.6k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh. Ore industry specialization available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T11:39:00Z Okay bus lines set and used traffic manager president edition (TMPE) to ban all private cars from the industrial commercial area.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T12:23:00Z Busy Town population 5.5k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers. Two lane road with trees, this is my go-to local road, starting using it now and when time comes, will upgrade existing dirt roads with this one. Oil industry specialization available.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Green_Plains_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T12:48:00Z Big Town population 7.5k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant, intercity bus, university and large warehouse are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T12:56:00Z Small City population 11k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train terminal, train station (passengers!) and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
Created passenger train station at the end of arterial road, quite long way, but should work OK.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T13:25:00Z Big City population 16k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T14:05:00Z Capital City population 32k.
</p>

<p>
Passenger and cargo harbor is now available, passenger is a must have for incoming citizens.
</p>

<p>
Current setup, cargo train terminal on the left is pushing weight, industrial commercial area in the middle and on the right is high density residential zone.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1415.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1415.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
My bus lines are not being used much anymore, all the people visiting commercial zone apparently come from the next door high density residential area. Pedestrian paths are in heavy use.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1417.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1417.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Looks awesome, works awesome. I have to design this setup for all terrains, its just so awesome method of transport: walk.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T14:36:00Z Colossal City population 44k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T16:12:00Z Metropolis population 65k.
</p>

<p>
I'm scared that something happens in the industrial area which causes traffic gridlock again, now it runs smoothly, amazingly smoothly, current traffic flow is 83% and no problems in the industrial area.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1614.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1614.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Actually when looking at the screenshot, it looks like very few vehicles delivering products heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T16:37:00Z Saved game and let it run on 3x time acceleration speed, now its my lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T17:01:00Z Megalopolis population 80k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T17:02:00Z Feeding time is over, lets push this savegame to the finish line! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now its kind of slow going, this is latest work I've done, new expansion to high density residential areas, grid but not in perfect 0/180/90/270 angle heh.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1722.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1722.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
And as you can see by the icons, office zones are having some highly educated workers problem.
</p>

<p>
It is very nice to see new citizens willing to walk to their new homes from train station <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1730.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1730.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
While waiting for couple of thousand last citizens to move in, I'm wondering why does this city look so small as overall real-estate space, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T18:04:00Z Hooyah! 100k population reached, yeah buddy! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm actually I didn't patiently wait for the numbers to stabilize and hit F12 for screenshot and right at that moment it dropped below 100k again for a moment hehe.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1805.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-08T1805.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
This was nice terrain savegame, will be fun to return to this some day, hopefully heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-08T18:06:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, we are done here.
