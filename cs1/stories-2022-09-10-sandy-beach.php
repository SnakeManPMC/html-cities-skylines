List updated: 2022-08-27T21:39:00Z
</p>

<p>
Very excited as there are only three terrains left (including this one) in my stories terrain savegame marathon! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Pretty OK looking terrain, not my favorite but at least there is no stupid mountains.
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles for use. TM:PE enabled disable de-spawning, advanced vehicle AI enabled, 50% dynamic lane selection, parking AI enabled more realistic parking. Transfer manager ce, goods delivery options warehouse first, reserve trucks for local transfers 20%, improved inter-warehouse transfers, import/export disabled allow import goods, services prefer local district services, death care/garbage improved all three, general disable dummy traffic, vehicle AI enable garbage and police.
</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
This is my current starting setup, plan is to advance industrial area right away towards the railroad tracks as cargo train terminal is our key to victory for providing jobs through good industry (traffic). <i>Aaand of course I forgot to take the screenshot</i> <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First save game for Sandy_Beach_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T17:39:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T17:47:00Z Little Hamlet population 500.
</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial. Purchased elementary school and landfill site.
</p>

<p>
This terrain overall looks flat but there are very small elevantion changes all over, nothing that would prevent enjoyable game-play but its interesting to see that this is really an untamed rural area for sure.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T17:56:00Z Worthy Village population 1k.
</p>

<p>
Did not create districts as I have no use for them now. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Sandy_Beach_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
I do kind of like the heightmap elevations in this terrain, gives it some character instead of being super flat.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T18:03:00Z Tiny Town population 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
Replaced placeholder dirt road arterial and collectors with proper six and four lane asphalt roads. Replaced industrial areas roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Sandy_Beach_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
Example of the small heightmap elevation differences.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Well, we have our first raffic jam in that tiny industrial commercial area, heh how is that possible <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

<p>
2022-09-10T18:26:00Z Restored budget to 100% which is the normal, glad to have that shuffle over now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T18:44:00Z Lunch break, hopefully city wont burn to the ground while I'm in the kitchen <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T18:51:00Z Busy Town population 4.8k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers. Two lane road with trees, this is my go-to local road, starting using it now and when time comes, will upgrade existing dirt roads with this one. Oil industry specialization available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T19:00:00Z Feeding time is over, back to growing some population.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train terminal, train station (passengers!) and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
Created passenger train station, but did not have enough money for cargo train terminal heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T20:04:00Z Got enough money and created cargo train terminal, wonky stuff but works.
</p>

<p>

2022-09-10T20:11:00Z Grand City population 18k.
</p>

<p>
Started to create foundations of a new industrial area far up in the north, only cloverleaf intersection there right now. RCI info bars has huge demand for uneducated workers, so lets greate mega cargo train terminal connected industrial area then. Just need to be super careful that the traffic wont "overflow" back to our main city area.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T20:34:00Z Its starting, its growing <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-10T2034.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-10T2034.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T20:44:00Z Capital City population 28k.
</p>

<p>
Passenger and cargo harbor is now available, passenger is a must have for incoming citizens.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T21:04:00Z Colossal City population 38k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T21:17:00Z Okay I got myself into traffic jam gridlock problem again. Guess I was too eager to zone big open areas for industrial here in the middle of nowhere, its so nice to zone freely as you have so much free space to use, nothing blocking you.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-10T2118.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-10T2118.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
So this is another baseline, this road grid is 30 units * 10 units size, there are 3 * 6 blocks or err road grids, ie zones inside road grid. This is too much, at least in the beginning it gets clogged up with traffic, even with private cars banned there.
</p>

<p>
I need to split that into two, maybe 3 * 3 block grids hmm. Or maybe even slimmer like 2 * 3 or something.
</p>

<p>
Gathering data... learning...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T21:46:00Z Metropolis population 55k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T22:19:00Z Starting to get a bit tired, lacking mental motivational energy to push some good upgrades into this city.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T22:20:00Z Megalopolis population 70k.
</p>

<p>
Oh, only 70k to reach that milestone, okay, okay...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T23:05:00Z Uuah! Sneakily population grew like crazy, I spent time working on some public transport and by accident noticed that whoah hey 100k population reached! Heh cool! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-10T2305.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-10T2305.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
And now I'm so tired its goodnight time...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-10T23:07:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, great to have another terrain savegame finished today, excellent day.
