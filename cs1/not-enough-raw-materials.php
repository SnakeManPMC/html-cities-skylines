<p>
How to fix "not enough raw materials" problem with your building?
</p>

<p>
Your specialized industries raw materials are depleted or import / export outside connections are not working.
</p>

<p>
Change specialized industry back to generic industry. Do this from "District and Areas".
</p>

<p>
If your GENERIC industrial building says "not enough raw materials" then it means your outside connections are delayed by traffic jams or maybe even completely blocked. Check your highway connection or cargo train terminal railroad network etc.
