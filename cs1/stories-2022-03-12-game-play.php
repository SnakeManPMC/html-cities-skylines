<p>
<b>2022-03-12</b> Game-play.
</p>

<p>
Release was v1.14.0-f8.
</p>

<p>
I was extremely burnt out and bored with <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/terrain.php" target="_blank">ArmA 3 Terrain</a> editing, I've done TWO (2) Cities Skylines installs, game-plays and uninstalls since my previous text story, but now I felt like wanting to learn some more of the game-play to really create a large working city.
</p>

<p>
My previous city went into bankruptcy because <a href="garbage.php">Garbage</a> collection was bogged down behind bad road design, then residents left in huge wave as garbage piled up, I ran out of money... had no way to fix the roads to allow better garbage collection which would have allowed residents to come back. Game / savegame ended in failure, I could not save the city, this was my first "game over" in Cities Skylines <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Plan now is to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CityPlannerPlays/videos" target="_blank">City Planner Plays tutorials</a>, really learn AND DOCUMENT the basics, then try to get a really big city going. Previously I created population of 100k cities twice, so lets now put a nice round number goal of 500k residents.
</p>

<p>
Yes I want to have proper traffic, industry and the airports going as well.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T16:38:00Z Started new game, terrain: grand river, build-able area 84% with all the connections.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T16:47:00Z little hamlet pop 360.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T16:54:00Z worthy village pop 750.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T16:59:00Z tiny town pop 1.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T17:09:00Z boom town pop 2.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T17:33:00Z busy town pop 4.6k.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T18:04:00Z big town pop 7.5k.
</p>

<p>
Took a short break here (had to shutdown the game). Overall progress was good, but when I expanded to the other side of the river I felt like I fell to my old ways of just spamming roads and shit, also the outside connection highway seems to allow AI traffic (are there another kind? hah) to just pass through that road without even having any business in my city, that sucks, I might limit the access only to my city hmm.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T19:26:00Z small city pop 10k.
</p>

<p>
Kind of struggling here with city design again, I tried to make traffic roundabouts but they look childish and wont flow traffic nicely.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T19:46:00Z big city pop 17k.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T20:09:00Z grand city pop 22k.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-12T23:24:00Z capital city pop 36k.
</p>

<p>
Now I get to build cargo harbor.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-13T00:15:00Z colossal city pop 48k.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-13T04:47:00Z metropolis pop 70k.
</p>

<p>
Now can create airports.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-13T07:37:00Z Shut it down, its been a long day, feeling really exhausted and in the past few hours there has been no progress, getting the <a href="death-wave.php">Death Wave</a> I guess. Also roads traffic is still a no go, I cant make the roads working properly.
</p>

	<h2>2022-03-13 More City Building</h2>

<p>
2022-03-13T21:37:00Z Continued playing even though was not really in the mood, I woke up, ate and did my usual morning chores and had no feeling to continue playing, but what else would I do. Spent some time watching city planner plays tutorials about roads and my goal now is to fix the horrible traffic jams and overall mess that my roads are.
</p>

<p>
Basically idea is to load the savegame up and if I fuck it up... I'll just restart.
</p>

<p>
2022-03-13T21:48:00Z Well that lasted long. Tried to do roundabout and failed miserably. Back to watching tutorials ... <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
While searching for those tutorials I watched youtube recommended video about "Cities Skylines object limit" which was shocking. Googled it a bit and indeed there is an object limit so once your city gets really big... there is artificial limit and its game over.
</p>

<p>
<b>2022-03-13T22:04:00Z Decided to uninstall this game and ONCE AND FOR ALL, NOT EVER PLAY AGAIN. Period.</b>
