Uh oh the name sounds like this is going to be a very short savegame story ...
</p>

<p>
However this is the last WINTER terrain! Whohoo! You can read my thoughts on WINTER terrains from the previous stories, will not repeat them here.
</p>

<p>
Oh hell no...

<p>
What is this horror? <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This terrain sucks ass so bad its not even funny. Starting grid is on some hilltop which looks like it belongs to ArmA 3 Vietnam: The Experience mod instead of Cities Skylines, kind of reminds of swiss alps or whatever those skiing things are, just disgusting as Cities Skylines terrain heightmap. Its hilarious as highway is zig zagging its way to the mountain top haha, guess the terrain dev is not familiar what HIGHWAY really means.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0613.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0613.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Also looking at the heightmap for suitable road grids and building placement... it would be extremely tough to fit 100k population to this terrain, can be done I think but man it would be such a struggle.
</p>

<p>
Yeah lets give hard NO for this piece of shit terrain <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

2022-09-06T06:13:00Z Yeah I'm going to save this stub of a game-play story text just for the history books, as a warning to never attempt even playing this shit "mapz". Sorry but its not cheating on your all terrains play through marathon if you skip a shitty one, its one thing that I hate WINTER terrains but look at this fucking ridiculous heightmap and tell me with a straight face that you could enjoyably create 100k population city here. Yeah didn't think so.
</p>

<p>
So now I'm writing this web page up and then move into the final phase of my terrain savegame game-play marathon which is the original non DLC terrains (I assume), which will be enjoyable temperate, boreal etc normal terrain types without any WINTER shit. I love it, cant wait to get started.
