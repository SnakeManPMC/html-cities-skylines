<p>
How to fix "not enough customers" problem with your buildings?
</p>

<p>
Commercial building reports "not enough customers", fix: too many commercial zones (I think, no way to tell other than "learn it").
</p>

<p>
Customers might not be able to reach commercial zone, traffic jams and lack of public transportation for example.
</p>

<p>
Create <a href="bus.php">bus</a> line and <a href="metro.php">metro</a> line from residential areas to your commercial areas where you get "not enough customers" icon floating above building(s). Usually a good metro line does wonders for people visiting the commercial area.
