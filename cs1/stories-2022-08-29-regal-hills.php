<p>
Eeww european theme with those stupid sizes education buildings etc, ugh. Oh well lets get it done.
</p>

<p>
No matter how nice the heightmap terrain is, my goal is to just get 100k population by fastest way possible, some industry in the beginning and then spamming offices and high density residential, no other time wasting nonsense.
</p>

<p>
Oh hell no this is as name says very hilly mountain terrain, horrible place to build a city, sigh.
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles.
</p>

<p>
Starting setup, gotta start somewhere. Man this terrain is going to be a nightmare.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T03:47:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
First save game for Regal_Hills_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T03:59:00Z Little Hamlet population 460.
</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T04:08:00Z Worthy Village population 950.
</p>

<p>
Created my first districts for PMC Residential 1, PMC Industrial 1. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Regal_Hills_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T04:17:00Z Tiny Town population 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
Replaced PMC Industrial 1 district roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Placed warehouse yard to PMC Industrial 1 district, set it to commercial goods and named it PMC Goods WH 1.
</p>

<p>
Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Regal_Hills_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T04:22:00Z And small warehouse yard is full, heh amazing how quickly it fills up. This is the amount of industrial buildings is needed to fill that warehouse in few moments.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-29T0424.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-29T0424.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Not much, eh? <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Placed first high school using "institute of creative arts" with student capacity 2349.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T04:36:00Z Increased budget back to 100% where it belongs. I am suffering. This terrain sucks so bad. Yes there is a lot of land, but the heightmap elevations are not suitable for city area, hills and mountains everywhere, hard to find and flat spots where to place buildings.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T04:38:00Z Boom Town population 2.6k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T04:40:00Z Actually felt frustrated to be playing on this kind of terrain, eeww, I cannot wait for next one which hopefully is normal heightmap again where I can just enjoy Cities Skylines game-play.
</p>

<p>
And with that, I'm off to eat lunch while game runs in 3x speed.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T05:08:00Z Feeding time is over, back to euro trash.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T05:36:00Z Hmm I'm not going to post many screenshots of this one, maybe around 50k population mark one progress shot and then the finish, unless something noteworthy happens on the way.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T05:45:00Z Busy Town population 5k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Regal_Hills_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T06:01:00Z Uuh boring wait, plenty of residential zoned, but people are moving in very slowly.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T06:19:00Z Big Town population 7.5k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant, university and large warehouse are now available. Uuh finally! I was bored to death here waiting for this milestone to kick in.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T06:30:00Z Small City population 11k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train station and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T06:47:00Z Big City population 17k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T07:07:00Z Grand City population 22k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T07:42:00Z Capital City population 32k.
</p>

<p>
Cargo harbor is now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T08:22:00Z Colossal City population 44k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T10:54:00Z Megalopolis population 80k.
</p>

<p>
Alright last milestone done.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T11:29:00Z Its time to call it a night, really tired and 17hrs awake alarm went off some time ago already.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T18:14:00Z New Cities Skylines day has started, just woke up and did the usual computer chores, nothing new in the world and computers are running good. Before days first meal, going to continue with this savegame.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T18:29:00Z Nothing much going on, PMC Industrial 3 district is completely traffic gridlocked, its not moving at all. The beginning part of this terrain savegame area is working fine. Dunno if just giving it more and more time is the answer or do I have to clear traffic again, I really don't want to as its such a drastic measure and elsewhere in the city things are running good.
</p>

<p>
Anyways off to eat days first meal now...
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T18:58:00Z Feeding time is over, back to gridlock.
</p>

<p>
Decided to de-zone about 80% of PMC Industrial 3 district because if its not working, whats the point. Traffic was bumper to bumper for kilometers in the highway and cargo train terminal was pushing in vehicles as well.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T19:52:00Z Enough high density residential has been zoned, industry and high density commercial reduced, now its just matter of time waiting for until we reach our goal.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T20:05:00Z Uah and done, finally, 100k population reached!
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-29T2005.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-29T2005.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Alright, time to retire this terrain, I've had enough of rough hillside mountain heightmap, bye.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-29T20:06:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, off to the next terrain, hopefully it will be better than this crap.
