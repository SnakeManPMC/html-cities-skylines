<p>
2022-09-03T10:30:00Z Started savegame on Windfield, all outside connections and natural resources, suitable area for building 65%, base theme: temperate.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: 81 tiles, camera position utility, cinematic camera extended v0.5.1, csl show more limits, enhanced outside connections view, extended game options, extra landscaping tools, first person camera, harmony v2.2, hide it, lifecycle rebalance revisited v1.6.4, optimize outside connections, precision engineering, random tree rotation, realistic population 2 v2.0.5, rebalanced industries, roundabout builder, TM:PE stable v11.6.6.3, transfermanager ce v1.8.10, transporttool v2.3.1, ultimate level of detail, unlimited oil and ore, unlimited soil. List updated: 2022-08-27T21:39:00Z
</p>

<p>
Just moments ago finished previous terrains savegame and felt kind of exhausted, then watched two episodes of beavis and butt-head and now don't know what to do, so lets start the next terrain savegame heh.
</p>

<p>
This terrain is half water and has several rivers, or well one with several branches. Hmm. But looks like there is plenty of flat areas to build a city, should be no problem.
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles for use. TM:PE enabled disable de-spawning, advanced vehicle AI enabled, 50% dynamic lane selection, parking AI enabled more realistic parking. Transfer manager ce, goods delivery options warehouse first, reserve trucks for local transfers 20%, improved inter-warehouse transfers, import/export disabled allow import goods, services prefer local district services, death care/garbage improved all three, general disable dummy traffic, vehicle AI enable garbage and police.
</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
This is what our starter setup looks this time.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T10:39:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
First save game for Windfield_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T10:48:00Z Little Hamlet population 480.
</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial. Purchased elementary school and landfill site. Had to actually wait a moment for my budget to increase so I could buy "community school" which has larger student capacity.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T10:53:00Z Had a first waiting period while city was growing, had nice slot of road grid zoned and nothing to do but wait...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T10:55:00Z Worthy Village population 950.
</p>

<p>
Again decided not to create districts as they don't really do anything beneficial to me right now. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Windfield_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
Got three (3) fires at the same time. Wonder if this is one of those silly terrains where you have insane forest fires every 15min or so...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T11:00:00Z Another fire, yup apparently this is stupid fire terrain then.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T11:03:00Z Tiny Town population 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
Replaced placeholder dirt road arterial and collectors with proper six and four lane asphalt roads. Replaced industrial areas roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Windfield_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
This is actually pretty nice looking terrain besides half of it being water, kind of shame to just do mindless road grid high density residential and office zoning to get population to meet our goal. But maybe I'll return to this and other nice looking terrain savegames and do like proper re-design to them with better time and interest. Maybe.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, decent looking terrain on the land parts.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T11:17:00Z Restored roads, electric and water budget back to 100% which is the normal.
</p>

<p>
Fires are out of fucking control, man this terrain actually sucks ass, there are so many fires there has been probably already more fires than in my previous savegame total, well perhaps not exactly but you get my point <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Its got to be terrain setting, percentage of fires or something like that, unless its simply randomly chosen on "New Game" click. Of course it could be real time random but nah, I've now played dozens of terrains to 100k population and some has very few fires and others are useless like this, fire after fire after fire ... hell this has even multiple fires at the same time. Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T11:21:00Z Boom Town population 2.8k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T11:27:00Z Another fucking fire, this is ridiculous...
</p>

<p>
And now we wait again for growth.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T11:49:00Z Its time for a lunch break, game will run 3x time acceleration speed so next milestone kicks in while I'm eating pretty sure, oh well.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T11:57:00Z Busy Town population 5.5k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers. Two lane road with trees, this is my go-to local road, starting using it now and when time comes, will upgrade existing dirt roads with this one. Oil industry specialization available.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Windfield_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T12:14:00Z Feeding time is over, last game-play stretch of the day beging, aayeah.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T12:21:00Z Just upgraded dirt roads to asphalt roads with trees, let that be the last time, its too painful to upgrade those roads as Cities Skylines is somehow laggy when doing it, mouse cursor is like off and its just frustrating. From now on I'll start to use asphalt two lane roads as local roads from the savegame start, no matter how expensive it is for the budget. It is more expensive for my sanity to do this stupid fucking road upgrade at later stage of the savegame <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T12:29:00Z Big Town population 8k.

Just after that milestone my alarm went off, been awake 17hrs, hmm I'll continue while can still think heh. Unfortunately at 75k population I don't think we can finish this today...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T16:56:00Z Megalopolis population 90k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-03T17:10:00Z Yeah buddy! We reached 100k population, I was snoozing off falling asleep waiting for city to grow but managed to keep my eyes open until the end, whee! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-03T1710.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-03T1710.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
