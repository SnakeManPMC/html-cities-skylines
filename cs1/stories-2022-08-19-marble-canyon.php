Hmm I have depleted all the ore from PMC Ore 1 district, how is that possible as I have unlimited oil and ore addon enabled. Or do I, hmm... it should be, but need to check next time exiting the game. Also extended game options has unlimited oil and ore, so I am slightly confused how it runs out hmm hmm.

<p>
Got little side tracked with the industry stuff, but yeah it was fun. It probably will be glorious one day to return into this savegame and start to casually play as there is no other goals to chase <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-19T23:34:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, this savegame is done for now, off to other adventures.
</p>

<p>
BTW when exited to main menu I went to content manager to check and as I remembered, unlimited oil and ore addon IS enabled. Hmph, I don't get it how does it deplete then. Oh well something to google after web page has been created heh. Adios.
