<p>
2022-08-21T11:40:00Z Started savegame on Twin Fjords, all but plane outside connections, suitable area for building 69%, base theme: boreal.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: ActionCam, BrokenNodeDetector, CameraPositions, CargoHoldFix, ChirpyExterminator, CinematicCameraExtended, CitiesHarmony, CSLShowMoreLimits, EmergencyCam, ExtendedGameOptions, FarmingCam, FirstPersonCamera_Updated, ForestryCam, HelicopterCam, LifecycleRebalanceRevisited, OilCam, OreCam, PublicTransportCam, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder, ShowIt, TMPE, TrainCam, TransferManagerCE.
</p>

<p>
This terrain starting location looks absolutely awful, its rough heightmap and just terrible place to start a city. Did a camera fly over of the whole terrain and was shocked, this place totally sucks. Fjords is like river mountain terrain landscape and indeed there are very little space where you can build your city on.
</p>

<p>
This savegame will be extremely uncomfortable "just get it over with" type of thing, I'm going to start with 1 x 1 unit square low density residential, once getting high density milestone done then wont be replacing the 1x1's but just spam high density residential and offices as much as education system allows me to.
</p>

<p>
Sigh this terrain <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

Okay situation update, traffic gridlock mostly because huge commercial district which gets deliveries, my industrial is hmm medium to large-ish, also a lot of people are now moving into the city with private cars which cause more traffic. Education is not good enough for to get office workers yet.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-21T16:54:00Z Feeding time is over, back to the city.

</p>

<p>
This is what I mean by useless Cities Skylines terrain heightmap, good luck building a city here.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
As for my traffic jam problem, the culprits are these two. Huge commercial area which felt like a great idea in the beginning and well I don't think that industrial area is not even that big yet, but guess it generates enough traffic anyways.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-21T1847.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-21T1847.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
One of these days I'll track down how many trucks does what amount of industrial buildings generate, would be nice to have a guideline like at how many 4x4 unit square buildings are too much for one collector road for example.
</p>

<p>
I don't think its going to be a problem to have a many industry areas, if they are separated with proper outside connections.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-21T19:48:00Z This is the worst terrain I've ever played in Cities Skylines.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-21T19:49:00Z Uaah finally done, 100k population reached!
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-21T1949.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-21T1949.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Now quickly save and NEVER return to this shit terrain, ever <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
