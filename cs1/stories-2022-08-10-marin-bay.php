<p>
2022-08-10T13:26:00Z Started savegame on Marin Bay, all outside connections, suitable area for building 61%, base theme: temperate.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: CargoHoldFix, ExtendedGameOptions, Harmony, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder.
</p>

<p>
What an terrible starting location, hopefully this terrain would get better when you expand but first impression is really really bad.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-10T13:32:00Z Little Hamlet population 300.
</p>

<p>
Okay now we got taxes and money starts to come in. But I don't think we can grow enough in this small island, heh ridiculous. This is without the doubt the worst starting location for a terrain I've ever seen in Cities Skylines.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-10T13:38:00Z Worthy Village population 600.
</p>

<p>
Purchased the terrain grid tile towards north, hopefully it gets us started with proper city building.
</p>

This is so stupid and cheaty, but heh gotta give it a try if we get to population goal with less landscape used <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

2022-08-10T15:24:00Z This savegame, well terrain, is such a crap. I don't like this at all, but lets get it to 100k population so I can mark this terrain played and move on.
