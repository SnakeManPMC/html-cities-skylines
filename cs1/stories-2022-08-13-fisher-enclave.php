<p>
2022-08-13T15:41:00Z Started savegame on Fisher Enclave, all but railroad outside connections, suitable area for building 45%, base theme: european.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: CargoHoldFix, ExtendedGameOptions, Harmony, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder, ShowIt, LifecycleRebalanceRevisited, TransferManagerCE.
</p>

<p>
Umm this terrain looks like shit, only 45% buildable landmass, huge amounts of water, I bet its going to be a real nightmare try to populate 100k people in this kind of terrain, but hey lets give it a try, I can always get frustrated and disable whole terrain for good.
</p>

<p>
This is the starting setup before unpausing game. Not very good, but yeah well.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1711.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1711.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
Painted district for oil industry, no I don't want to repeat previous savegames oil hell, but why not spice up the industry a bit if there is a natural resource just where you going to create small industry area.
</p>

<p>
PMC Oil 1 district done and zone assigned, hmm lets see how bad it will be with the semi-truck tanker traffic through that residential neighborhood. You should never ran such traffic through a residential...
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1719.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1719.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
PMC Farmland 1 district created for industrial use. Nevermind the horrible highway ramps, I'll try to forget that as well <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1743.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1743.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T17:57:00Z When I created quite long bus route, it added twenty seven (27) buses for that route, haha. It always pays to check transport lines dialog how the current line is running. Now I reduced vehicle count modifier down to 12% so its only using 4 buses, that is more than enough for this line, considering the two stops both have 0 passengers waiting heh. Well one bus has 5 passengers, other has 1, so its not completely empty line.
</p>

<p>
Created PMC Forestry 1 district for, yup forest lumber stuff.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1808.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-13T1808.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

</p>

<p>
Hmm not sure if I want to expand these farming and forestry specialized industrial areas more as they already are sending out so many trucks that it starts to be terror on the roads.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T20:09:00Z Alarm went off in the phone, been up 17hrs, still not tired though and have been fun investigating / learning about bus and metro routes <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
No. I deny any knowledge or involvement in health neglect in this city. No such thing has happened. Never.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-13T22:27:00Z Okay I'm dead tired in zombi mode, its well past my bed time, nites.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T05:01:00Z New Cities Skylines building day has started, just woke up and finished morning chores, haven't eaten yet, lets get things going on in this savegame first.
</p>

<p>
New PMC Residential 4 is good to start building. Our current population is 47.5k so we have still plenty to do today, its not sure if this terrain can be "won" with the amount of landmass we have available, but we'll give it a try.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0519.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0519.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Doing this city from one edge to another, one 4 x 4 unit zone at the time.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T05:33:00Z Metropolis population 55k.
</p>

<p>
Got metro line setup, still not sure how to make perfect metro lines, guess they should be loops in both directions but dunno mine turn out like this often heh.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0541.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0541.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T05:54:00Z Megalopolis population 70k.
</p>

<p>
Okay all milestones done, I am getting very hungry, its time to cook a meal and eat it. I'll save game and let it run with 3x speed, hopefully not too much breaks while I'm away.
</p>

<p>
But before that purchased all terrain grid tiles first.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0555.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0555.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T05:56:00Z Okay lunch break ...
</p>

<p>
How stupid of me to place recycling center right in the center of high density residential district, what was I thinking?
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0618.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0618.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Deleted it and we move on, I'll figure out garbage collection problem after eating.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T06:50:00Z Feeding time is over, lets back to finish this city <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
There is a problem with not enough educated workers which then turn into abandoned buildings, going to figure out why and fix it.
</p>

<p>
Not enough workers and educated workers came from office zones, apparently city has a shortage of highly educated people. Hmm could this be caused by lack of universities (maybe even high schools) or the LifecycleRebalanceRevisited addon which does something for peoples life spans, no idea what it does other than "good stuff" heh, guess I'll take authors word for it hehe.
</p>

<p>
Now I de-zoned ALL offices, did not replace them with anything yet.
</p>

<p>
Current education pipeline is elementary school eligible 6.4k with capacity 8.4k, high school eligible 14.6k with capacity 11k and university eligible 11.9k with capacity 13.5k. So seems like we need more high schools.
</p>

<p>
Slight overkill to spam so many high schools in one group, but we are in short of real estate here, so don't judge me too harsh. Lets make a good bus route to those schools from nearest metro station, should work good enough.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0700.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Hmm actually we don't even need buses because that metro station is so close these high school bums can easily walk the distance.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0704.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0704.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Hah yeah, look at that group of people coming off the metro, yeah we need no stinking buses here <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0706.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0706.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Next problem is garbage, our capacity is severely lacking currently. In some of my previous savegame a long time ago the waste processing complex was deemed to be stupid because it activates icon about transfer facility full all the time making you think something is wrong even though its normal, however I would like to try those again now with proper experience and documentation.
</p>

<p>
So created waste processing complex to lake bottom (heh) and then placed transfer facilities across the city.
</p>

<p>
First near residential area waste transfer facility, covered with high density commercial buildings beyond pollution range.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0840.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0840.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T08:43:00Z Garbage status, black buildings are the new ones I just placed. Big ones are the waste processing complexes and smaller waste transfer facilities. Lake bottom also has two incineration plants and advanced inland water treatment plants.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0843.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0843.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Cant wait to see how these work in action, hopefully this would be more fancier setup than my previous dumb "throw bunch of incinerators on the side road" heh.
</p>

<p>
Garbage collection and disposal seems to be working good <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0851.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0851.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
One thing I don't understand is why these facilities including incinerator plants, mostly send out very few trucks?
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0852.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0852.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
I have seen incinerator plants being maxed out 27 trucks, but its a rare thing. Usually even though the city has a lot of garbage you only get like in that screenshot 2 trucks out. Shouldnt garbage collection being never ending loop that your trucks are constantly running day in day out, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Created PMC Residential 5 district, will be all high density buildings, lets get our population up <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0931.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0931.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T09:44:00Z Tried to add office 4 x 4 unit square grid back to see how many educated people we have. It was 80 worker office and 0 jobs available when it was level 2 and upgrading to 3. Hmm ok so I'll keep adding some offices until we start to have problems with highly educated people.
</p>

<p>
We got a really bad thunderstorm, lighting left and right, several fires got started including these two forest fires.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0951.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0951.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Fire department helicopter crews were on the job.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0955.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T0955.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T10:10:00Z This thunderstorm is really starting to piss me off, its fucking relentless, just keeps hammering lighting strikes all across the terrain without mercy and it lasted a really long time (just finished when typing this paragraph).
</p>

<p>
Waste transfer facilities all three of them by PMC Residential 5 district are overwhelmed, they are full "all the time". Dunno if the waste processing complex is too far away or what is going on. The transfer facility capacity is only 250k and if I understood correctly one garbage truck is 50k, hmm not sure about these numbers but that capacity doesn't last long if this is the case.
</p>

<p>
As said before I hate the full icon showing up for that like something is wrong, but there is not, the facility just waits for garbage truck to come empty it which is all automatic, so hmph yeah.
</p>

<p>
Purchased another waste processing complex as the two existing ones were maxed out 15 garbage trucks, I think they got overwhelmed which could explain the furthest out waste transfer facilities being full all the time.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1027.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1027.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
BTW one garbage truck is 20,000 capacity, whatever that number means, "units" I guess heh.
</p>

<p>
Waste transfer facility and waste processing complex doesn't seem to be very good. I now have three complexes and dunno how many total transfer facilities, there are THREE (3*250k capacity) in this district alone.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1035.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1035.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Highway connection to this part of the city, the fear is that it would unleash too much traffic in residential area, so we need to keep an eye on that.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1047.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1047.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T11:08:00Z Alright was so concentrated on doing some highway stuff that didn't even notice we already hit our goal, 100k population! Yeah! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1107.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-14T1107.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-14T11:09:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, we are done here.
