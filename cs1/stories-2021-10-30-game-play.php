<b>2021-10-30</b>
</p>

<p>
DLC release used was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1531470/Cities_Skylines__Content_Creator_Pack_Train_Stations/" target="_blank">Cities Skylines Train Stations</a>.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T17:09:00Z Few minutes ago started to play, terrain was the largest build-able area, dunno what was its name hehe. Goal is to reach 100,000 population.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T17:24:00Z little hamlet population 500.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T17:44:00Z worthy village population 1k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T17:55:00Z tiny town population 1.6k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T18:36:00Z boom town population 2.8k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T19:17:00Z busy town population 5.5k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T19:50:00Z big town population 8k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T20:34:00Z I had a problem with my city, industry buildings said <a href="not-enough-buyers-for-products.php">Not Enough Buyers For Products</a>. I googled this and found some info that I don't have enough import/export route connections, either roads, railroads or ships, or simply not enough residential zones.
</p>

<p>
There was some claims that the zone indicator graphical bars doesn't exactly mean that you "MUST" build stuff when bar is visible, for example that industrial even if the bar is visible you should not build more that visually in 3D game-world you always need more residential than industrial, physically in the world.
</p>

<p>
So I'm now going to not build any more industrial and max out residential zone as much as I have cash, also make sure there is export/import routes for industrial area. For example I know already my industrial area is locked behind one road connection which is almost like a U shape instead of good flowing O shape aka <a href="roundabout.php">Roundabout</a> for all directions so to speak. So I'm gonna fix those.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T21:02:00Z small city population 11k.
</p>

<p>
This upgrade now allows me to build a cargo train station, this will probably help with that industrial over production issue mentioned previously.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T21:26:00Z Well more residential zones while ignoring industrial bar completely and train station did the trick, now my industrial zone is flourishing (with industrial bar being 80% full too). Nice to see trains running regularly out of the city.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T21:45:00Z big city population 17k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T22:20:00Z grand city population 22k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-30T23:39:00Z capital city population 34k.
</p>

<p>
This upgrade now allows me to create cargo ship yard, to export/import goods, lets see what can we do with that.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-31T00:24:00Z colossal city population 46k.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-31T02:06:00Z metropolis population 70k.
</p>

<p>
With this upgrade I got airport including cargo airport. Okay lets start exporting some shit <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-10-31T02:57:00Z megapolis population 85k.
</p>

<p>
This upgrade got hmm unless I'm mistaken an even larger airports including cargo one. Lets check it out.
</p>

	<h2>2021-10-31 Population 100,000</h2>

<p>
2021-10-31T03:41:00Z just reached population 100,000, hmm so I guess my goals are met hehe. Well I still have several hours of this day left so I'll continue playing.
</p>

<p>
2021-10-31T04:39:00Z population 121,000 well I guess its time to quit at this point, dunno what to do in this city anymore as I cannot expand those 2km grids anymore. Was quite fun game-play with that goal in mind to get 100k population, had no idea I could achieve it with mere hours of game-play.
</p>

<p>
Nice gaming session.
</p>

<p>
I have to say that dunno if I want to play some more in the future, I mean ... when you do one city like this, whats different on some other terrain, its just repeating the same formula all over again. I was hoping kind of infinite growth opportunity but these (well, this) terrains are quite small so you are quite limited of how large city you can create.
</p>

<p>
Same old story, every game has too small terrain, except <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/" target="_blank">ArmA 3</a> <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Aaaanyways, like I said, I feel happy, was fun day of cities skyline gaming, created one big city (within this games context).
</p>

	<h2>2021-10-31 Arid Plains</h2>

<p>
2021-10-31T23:18:00Z Was extremely bored so decided that instead of staring an empty discord chat screen, why not continue playing another terrain (now with harbor ocean) in Cities Skylines. OK, sure.
</p>

<p>
Terrain I chose was "Arid Plains", it has all the resources and outside connections, suitable area for building: 79% basically largest terrain with all features enabled.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Now I get to play with ships, cargo harbor <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T02:32:00Z colossal city pop 50k.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T02:59:00Z earthquake hit, wow never seen this happen before. Not sure I like it, I mean sure realistic to some parts of the globe, but... yeah just not sure if I like these natural disasters. I turned them off.
</p>

<p>
Earthquake hit quite close to my cargo train station, had to fix road, railroad tracks and water pipes, not too much other damage, I guess.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T03:30:00Z metropolis pop 75k.
</p>

<p>
Not sure what I did wrong but in the past hour growth has felt like very slow, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T04:05:00Z megalopolis pop 90k.
</p>

<p>
And with that I'm going to take a lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T04:29:00Z Feeding time over, back to running a city.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T06:50:00Z My industrial buildings had a lot of <a href="not-enough-raw-materials.php">"Not Enough Raw Materials"</a> issues. I checked out my harbor cargo port things and train cargo terminals and those were rocking and rolling constantly, just sheer pressure on them, so at least that should not be a problem.
</p>

<p>
Not about industry but for example <a href="garbage.php">Garbage</a> landfills, I had three landfills side by side, two was emptying, garbage truck appeared and started to haul trash to incineration plant. The thing is, there was FOUR (4) incineration plants right next to the landfills and this garbage truck decided to take the load into ANOTHER SIDE OF THE FUCKING CITY. Eh, no wonder why shit gets clogged up by traffic when AI makes such idiotic decisions. I don't get it.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T08:00:00Z Started to understand traffic a bit better, including cargo logistics. I build my first highway to by-pass traffic jam bottle neck area, getting excited about learning new stuff instead of just spamming zones down with fastest time acceleration zoomed all the way out, being completely distanced from the boots on the ground feeling.
</p>

<p>
Uhm, get it? OK.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T11:50:00Z Uuh dead tired, time to call it a night. City population 141k.
</p>

	<h2>2021-11-01 Undocumented Rage Unleashed</h2>

<p>
2021-11-01T18:03:00Z New gaming day has started, could not stay away, need to continue tweaking those logistic and other traffic routes <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After loading the savegame I was quite overwhelmed by the size of the city and just the complex spaghetti mess off "everything". There were some issues again with abandoned buildings, some commercial buildings said <a href="not-enough-customers.php">"Not Enough Customers"</a>.
</p>

<p>
It just seems like there is never ending issues going on and no fucking IN-GAME INFO how to fix them. Guess devs assume that everyone just googles these things how to play their fucking game.
</p>

<p>
Extremely frustrating.
</p>

<p>
Now don't get me wrong, if the game would play itself with press of a button it would not be fun, if you were to just expand the city endlessly without any issues what would be the point of it. But fuck this shit as I have NO IDEA why the fucking commercial zones have no customers as the fucking game doesn't tell me, why the fuck do I have to google this shit? <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T18:44:00Z was really frustrated by all the undocumented shit which you just have to magically know like commercial zones saying no customers etc. Quick search shows apparently I have too many commercial zones, but how the fuck do I know that, by magic?
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T18:45:00Z Lunch break... let the game run while I was eating.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T19:12:00Z Feeding time over, lets get back to frustration.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T19:15:00Z Next problem was that in my industrial area there was several "not enough buyers for products" issue.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-01T22:14:00Z Enough. Its a whack-a-mole fight against problem after problem when you basically have no clue what the fucking issue is, this is extremely frustrating game-play. Decided to stop playing.
</p>

<p>
Uninstalled Cities Skylines, I'm done.
</p>
