	<h2>Not Enough Buyers For Products Cities Skylines</h2>

<p>
Cities Skylines tells me on top of building icon: "not enough buyers for products", how to fix?
</p>

<p>
Industrial buildings reports "not enough buyers for products", this usually means that you have either too many industrial buildings or too few commercial buildings. It can also mean your import / export, outside connections (road, train, ship, airport), is not working or even present.
</p>

<p>
Traffic routes can also cause this issue, if you have huge traffic jams between industrial zone, commercial zone and/or outside connections, well you got a problem.
</p>

<p>
Traffic is the key, trust me on this one. Create six lane straight roads with few intersections to move your semi-trucks, vans, box trucks etc fast from A to B across the city.
