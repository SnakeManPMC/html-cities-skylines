	<h2>Stories 2022-08-15 Eden Valley Game-play</h2>

<p>
2022-08-15T14:11:00Z Started savegame on Eden Valley, all outside connections, suitable area for building 79%, base theme: temperate.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: CargoHoldFix, ExtendedGameOptions, Harmony, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder, ShowIt.
</p>

<p>
See my previous attempt in 2021 with this terrain: <a href="stories-2021-11-08-game-play.php">Stories 2021-11-08 Game-play</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately this time my goal is cold hearted brutal "I dont give a shit", all I care about is reaching 100k population as fast as possible, I wont be making realistic or pretty city, not caring about peoples welfare so if I can get by with something I'll do it. Most importantly I'll be spamming zones in patterned method like residential in the center, commercial next to it and then industrial, this way trucks or customers don't have to travel far, actually people should be able to walk to the commercial zone shops. Once high density milestone is reached I'll shift to spam offices which take up a lot of jobs which again requires residential which obviously increases population and well, there we go.
</p>

<p>
Now I actually hope this terrain is not very nice so I wont miss the opportunity to have some legit fun heh.
</p>

<p>
This is the setup before unpausing the game and starting to play. Oh forgot to mention in the opening, I'm also going to zone 2 x 2 unit squares for residential zone before we get to high density milestone to save space.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T14:16:00Z First save game for Eden_Valley_1 file name and unpaused the game.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T14:21:00Z Little Hamlet population 440.
</p>

<p>
Forgot to do the first two blocks as 2x2, heh. But we are growing the city, its a long process.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-15T1427.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-15T1427.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T14:31:00Z Worthy Village population 900.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T14:38:00Z Tiny Town population 1.4k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T14:53:00Z Boom Town population 2.4k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh. Bus depot is not, hehe.
</p>

<p>
Zoning 2x2 units sucks, but guess its the fastest, well I mean easiest way to get to high density milestone because otherwise it would take so many roads and so much landscape to populate with 4 x 4 size unit setups.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-15T1504.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-15T1504.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Feeling kind of bored, its one of those things that well okay fine maybe I'm bored but what else would I do than to play Cities Skylines right now, so here we are doing quickie terrain savegame heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T15:33:00Z Busy Town population 5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T15:34:00Z Whoops, as reflex I dragged box to whole road grid area for low density residential, uh oh, well it was quicker and easier for sure, but wastes so much real estate space on the ground. Oh well next one will be done as 2 x 2 units again until we reach next milestone.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T15:39:00Z Argh forgot again, I'm telling ya, its a reflex <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Not much feeling the love for this savegame, just really don't know what else to do, don't even have anything to watch movies/tv-show wise.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Eden_Valley_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-15T15:55:00Z Saved game for Eden_Valley_3 file name. And here I have to call it, I got zero interest continue playing right now, been doing 17hrs days for over a week, its all big blur, I need to take a break and watch some tv or anything to chill a bit. Will continue playing tomorrow after a good nights sleep, OR if I get extremely refreshed later tonight.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T05:49:00Z New Cities Skylines building day has started, relaxed last night watching movies/tv-shows, slept good, now just woke up and did morning chores but didn't eat yet, now I'm excited about playing Cities Skylines again, lets get this savegame finished.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T05:50:00Z Big Town population 7.5k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant and university are now available. Oh my and literally after 10 SECONDS of game-play <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I de-zoned everything into high density where possible, no office spaces yet. This will be insane shock to the system / city, hopefully the engine can recover from it, probably going to take a while, might be a severe power issues too. But I just wanted to blast off today heh.
</p>

<p>
As expected population plummeted to lowest what I saw was 100 heh, then started to grow back. Had power issues, water issues but got the water fixed, power remained out on many parts and that lead to abandoned buildings. So overall, yes do not "convert" low density to high density in an mass, it doesn't work because its too much of a shock to the system. You have to do them one small zone road grid at the time.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T06:08:00Z While the city recovers from this shock I'm off to eat days first meal while game runs in 3x time acceleration speed <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T06:13:00Z Small City population 11k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train station and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T06:27:00Z Big City population 17k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T06:35:00Z Feeding time is over, lets see how our city is doing.
</p>

<p>
Well during me being away eating I still used one hand to create one grid block of road for industry demand which was sky high, but overall things are settling down nicely, now just need to add more industry area to keep things going.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T06:42:00Z Grand City population 22k.
</p>

<p>
Cargo train terminal near the two industrial avenues, hopefully eases up the highway traffic.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0652.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0652.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Created metro subway line connecting all commercial areas, last night I read on paradox Cities Skylines wiki that public transport connection is most important to commercial areas above all else.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0715.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0715.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T07:30:00Z Capital City population 34k.
</p>

<p>
Cargo harbor is now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T07:44:00Z Saved game for Eden_Valley_4 file name which is now the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
Created second cargo train terminal on other side of the city.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0817.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0817.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T08:19:00Z Colossal City population 48k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
Is this high score in traffic, 3% with those red lines on HIGHWAYS leading beyond the screen width <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0858.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0858.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T09:07:00Z Metropolis population 70k.
</p>

<p>
Traffic was so bad that I started to see vehicles with missing trailers like semi-truck without any trailer, so he was hauling something... which was... not there, eh? I just recently read somewhere that this happens when vehicles number exceeds 16,384 which is the vehicle limit (they say 16k so I assume math 16384 power of two).
</p>

<p>
Saved game and then used TMPE clear traffic option which I assume deletes all vehicles, everywhere. Well that should clear the congestion up, but what does it do to our "economy" hmm, never used such feature, will be my first time and there is where savegame comes to play, if everything goes boom I can always revert back to the last save.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T09:22:00Z Well it only took few moments for everything to be congested again, these roads just arent working, there is too many vehicles trying to get into small two lane roads and nothing good comes out of it.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T09:33:00Z Megalopolis population 85k.
</p>

<p>
Last milestone achieved, now its just matter of time before we finish this savegame, unless something really breaks in the traffic again heh.
</p>

<p>
And with megalopolis milestone I can now buy all terrain grid tiles.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0940.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T0940.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
This is odd terrain, at the grid tile purchase menu it shows NO ship connections for all the coastline tiles, however they DO have ship connection when you actually try to place harbor, hmm very odd.
</p>

<p>
Seems like you cant trust terrain grid tile purchase dialog for connections, better check it yourself visually, at least in this terrain dunno if its same for all others.
</p>

<p>
Roundabout mayhem in SW corner of the city connecting highway outside connection to industrial area, but running it few minutes in 3x time acceleration it doesn't appear to start generating traffic, hmm some private cars in and few trucks coming out. Oh well at least there is a connection now.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1005.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1005.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Amazing how many people are willing to walk that far, look at all those ants crawling around hehe. Its a quite long distance to hike like that, maybe I'll create walking path for these guys with more direct access.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1007.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1007.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
New pedestrian walking path bridge over the highway really shifted the walkers there, nice.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1011.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Walking is good for you heh, excercise you maggots, move! Move! MOVE! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1012.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Pedestrian walking paths, check out how far these people are willing to walk, through the pavement path bridge from PMC Residential 4 to PMC Residential 5 which has the university.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1019.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1019.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of person walking to school, its quite the long way. Almost makes me feel like whats the point of creating bus route which takes up traffic capacity when these folks are willing to walk that far.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1022.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1022.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Public transport, metro view for the busiest line we have. I changed the metro train type to express something which holds 180 persons instead of default which is 150. There is still bigger ones but they are slower and longer which could cause congestion on some narrow spots.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1028.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1028.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
My way is to check out stops number which is how many persons are waiting, it should be less than train capacity per stop so that trains would travel as full as possible but not all the way full on every stop. Dunno, I'm no public transport expert in real life so just using common sense here heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T10:51:00Z We have reached the goal of 100k population, yeah baby! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1051.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-16T1051.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
In the end I actually started to enjoy myself setting up metro lines to ease up private car traffic and those walking paths, so in that sense kind of bummer that I have to stop playing this savegame now hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-16T10:52:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, this terrains gaming session is over, off to the next one.
