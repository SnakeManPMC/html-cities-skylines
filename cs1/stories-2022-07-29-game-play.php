	<h2>Stories 2022-07-29 Asanu Beach Game-play</h2>

<p>
This was originally labeled as "bums savegame" but read on, heh.
</p>

<p>
<b>2022-07-29</b> Game-play.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T03:16:00Z Started new savegame with Asanu Beach terrain. Idea is try to play without using industrial zones, meaning population would just work in offices and import commercial zone products.
</p>

<p>
I don't think this is going to work, but lets find out.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T03:33:00Z Placed basic starter kit, residential and commercial zones, then with 3x time acceleration sat and waited until now, only few buildings popped up, world seems to be frozen waiting for something, which obviously is industrial zone.
</p>

<p>
Well, that was interesting test. Odd thing is that some people talk about being self sufficient without any imports, hmm not sure how that is possible.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T03:39:00Z Yup nothing happening. Okay it was a worth the shot. Umm I have some time to kill before next meal so I'm going to place industrial zone and try to learn more about road hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
And immediately new residential buildings started to come up.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T03:44:00Z little hamlet pop 500.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T03:48:00Z worthy village pop 1k.
</p>

<p>
And with that my alarm went off to eat days 3rd meal, going to let game run while I eat and maybe free hand can do some mouse clicks between bites.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T04:14:00Z Feeding complete, back to the game. Two population achievements happened while eating. Hmm I would not like to continue this savegame, hmm but oh well lets do it anyway, going to learn about those roads.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T04:31:00Z busy town pop 5.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T04:40:00Z big town pop 8k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T04:57:00Z small city pop 11k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T05:28:00Z big city pop 18k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T06:03:00Z grand city pop 22k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T06:32:00Z Did first savegame with name "snake04".
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T07:17:00Z capital city pop 36k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T07:40:00Z Saved game, my eyes are very sore or strain how its called, not really tired yet but yeah going to take a shower hopefully that give my eyes a good boost.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T08:33:00Z colossal city pop 48k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T08:57:00Z Alarm went off for being awake 17hrs, pfft, I'll keep going <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T09:17:00Z metropolis pop 70k.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T10:03:00Z megalopolis pop 90k.
</p>

<p>
Uuh I'm so tired and eyes are sore, but gotta keep pushing on few more minutes.. <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T10:46:00Z City hit 102k population, time to call it a night, uuh so tired... Saved game and exited. Unsure if this continues tomorrow, now I actually hope it wouldnt but who knows. Nites.
</p>

	<h2>2022-07-29 New Offices</h2>

<p>
2022-07-29T18:26:00Z New city building day has started, slept pretty good, woke up, did morning chores, last night was planning on taking a look at some <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/" target="_blank">ArmA 3</a> steam shitshop downloads... but nah, I want to play Cities Skylines and learn the fucking road hierarchy, so launching the game up now.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T19:01:00Z Started to switch my very first industrial area to office district, its called Pyko Offices 1. This savegame started as no industries and then road learning experience, which both failed miserably heh. But lets now try to switch as much polluting industry to offices with higher educated folks and see how that works. Would be cool to see a city with no industry pollution at all or those insane export/import semi-trucks.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T19:24:00Z Now its time for days first meal, I'll let the city run 3x speed while I eat.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T19:50:00Z Feeding time is over, lets get back to offices and hopefully after that to make those roads better.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T20:14:00Z City is now industry free, not a single zoned unit with polluting industry, city looks healthy.
</p>

<p>
Only thing left polluting now is incinerator plants and of course sewage pumps by the river and ocean. This terrain is really relaxing as there are no issue with water like that flatlands farms or whatever its name was which was outright bugged.
</p>

<p>
Now I would want to move my incinerator plants from office district to somewhere else to pollute.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T20:32:00Z Moved two incinerator plants from pyko block 1 district to the centralized incineration area.
</p>

<p>
Result of switching from polluting industry to offices was greatly reduced traffic, all those semi-trucks and such are gone. I have to say that while it feels good to be "clean", this somehow feels like a diminished game-play to not use polluting generic industry zoning.
</p>

<p>
Yes the traffic is horrendous with heavy semi-trucks when you have generic industry, but now this game really feels like I'm only playing 50% of the content, weird...
</p>

<p>
Now I'm starting to see troubling trend, most of commercial zones have abandoned buildings. Hmm how is it possible that if we have reduced traffic by removing heavy vehicles (semi-trucks), we don't get the goods to the commercial zones, hmm. Or is it that generic industry produces so much more than a highway and cargo train connection can supply?
</p>

<p>
While writing this I was watching cargo train hub, trains arrive fully loaded with container boxes, get unloaded and just disappear which I assume means 100% of train car contents was unloaded. Cargo train terminal then spawns huge loads of vans and "box trucks" which head off to the city.
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Outside connections tab shows exports: 4, heh four? What is that four we export hehe. Imports hovering around 7k, 99% in the pie chart being "Goods".
</p>

<p>
Was monitoring the only highway connection we have and its same as train, nothing but vans and box trucks, with the occasional private citizen car.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T20:54:00Z City population is 132k.
</p>

<p>
I wish there was notification about population achievement, would be cool to be notified when you hit 100k, 200k, 500k and 1 million <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T20:58:00Z Build second cargo train terminal, lets see how this changes things.
</p>

<p>
There was no change, train kept going to the first cargo terminal. Then I created another one so now I have three cargo train terminals all connected together in one railroad line, trains just keep going to the first terminal and import units hovers in the 6.8k number very stable, there is basically no fluctuation in that number.
</p>

<p>
This is odd, hmm I need to google if you cant have more than one cargo train terminal.
</p>

<p>
BTW this terrain has no harbor ship connection, well not in the tiles I purchased at least.
</p>

<p>
Google shows that Cities Skylines is limited by imports, in this case commercial goods, if you rely 100% on importing them you cant make it work, as is seen in my savegame right now with the solid 6.8k import.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T22:00:00Z Finished bunch of reading; in short other people are reporting the same issue with no industry having limit on import.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately you need industry in Cities Skylines, oh well no clean cities then I guess.
</p>

<p>
Was a bit demoralized again after reading this stuff and seeing more game-play limits. There is a mod that increases the import limit but it also had some drawbacks and I <i>really</i> want to stay away from mods, I don't want to dig that deep into this game, googling is as far as I'm willing to go.
</p>

<p>
Cities skylines is supposed to be fun, its not a fucking job.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Going to add small industry area now with good road connection, lets see what that changes.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T22:13:00Z Got the small industry area setup in the far NW corner of the terrain, almost exact opposite as cargo train terminal, hehe. Then I built underground two lane industrial road from the cargo train terminal nearby area all the way to the industrial area, this should now ease off the heavy semi-truck traffic going through the city.
</p>

<p>
Import units now 7.5k, immediately increased when creating industry area. The best road type would be rail to connect to the outside and to commercial. Make sure you use 1 terminal for intercity cargo and a separate intercity line for commercial cargo.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-29T22:40:00Z Did googling on "the best industry road" and whoah another can of worms opened to depress me haha. Okay back to just doing stuff I do, lets see what happens.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T00:37:00Z Its chow time, going to keep city running in 3x speed while I eat.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T01:09:00Z Feeding time is over, now where were we...
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T03:39:00Z Whoah been three hours since feeding time, time flies when playing Cities Skylines. Not much to update, or at least nothing comes to mind. I did a huge forestry industry area on SE, its massive in Cities Skylines scale. Its a bit sparse but yeah it is big.
</p>

<p>
Commercial zones are still dead, so many abandoned buildings, pretty much most of them.
</p>

<p>
Upgraded the east side cargo train terminal roads from medium industry road to six lane err regular city road, that alone improved traffic so much, was awesome to see and somewhat surprising too.
</p>

<p>
All my roads are done lazily, they are just dirt roads hehe, the cheapest crappy roads you can have in this game... dunno why other than being lazy thinking that if I'm going to learn road hierarchy and do them properly, these dirt roads get changed anyways so why bother tinkering with small asphalt roads. Dunno, difficult to explain, I kinda don't care about them being dirt or asphalt.
</p>

<p>
For past several hours population has been stale, now its 141k which is not bad. Actually hmm wonder what is my high-score of all time, I have no recollection. But lets say this is it because now I'm going to backup these savegames no matter how rage quit I'll end these few days long gaming session.
</p>

<p>
Outside connections import 14.6k and export 7.7k.
</p>

<p>
Its interesting that I'm exporting a lot of forestry, but still also importing it as well, why is something produced only to be given away and then imported from elsewhere, doesn't make much sense to me.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T04:21:00Z As I'm writing this I just created relatively speaking huge high density residential area and population is increasing... well heh as I'm writing this RIGHT now it just broke 150k magical limit! Whohoo! New record for sure! <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Smiley :mrgreen:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<b>150,000 population</b> in Cities Skylines, whohoo <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T04:33:00Z Placed my first ever park. I never use these as they are useless pixel porno bullshit, I mean park, really, who gives a fuck about your stupid fucking parks...
</p>

<p>
They increase citizens happiness, which then increases .. dunno man, something. I placed this small park because it already was kind of huge area, only checked one bigger I think it was playground or something and it was HUGE, for fuck sake I'm not going to add useless shit like that in my cities.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T04:58:00Z Population now 170k and I'm starting to notice some stutter here and there, its still fully playable but often times when panning camera there is slight stutter. I bet this is just because the sheer number of citizens with vehicles and whatnot in the savegame.
</p>

<p>
Its a nice size city for sure, you can have plenty of fun with less population too so if this is the result of city this size then its not surprising or disappointing.
</p>

<p>
Or who knows maybe the game just needs an restart in my case, I have been playing now since hum what time did I start, hours and hours straight.
</p>

<p>
<b>2022-07-30T05:32:00Z Population now 181k</b> heh. Commercial zones are still in the toilet though, that generic industry did not help it at all.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T05:35:00Z Saved game and shut down cities skyline, need to restart it, maybe it clears any slight stuttering.
</p>

<p>
Dunno, it felt pretty much the same, playable but here and there you get a slight stutter.
</p>

<p>
I moved all the sewage pumps from river to the ocean, now it was just crazy line of pumps there heh.
</p>

<p>
Highway connection had insane number just endless stream of vehicles importing stuff. I tracked one vehicle and it disappeared before it even reached city limits, this could be some sort of time delay limit in the game that it removes dead vehicles which take too long to reach a destination, not sure just speculating, also I saw some people mention this in some website.
</p>

<p>
Overall at this point I'm starting to get that conzole peasant vibe from Cities Skylines, this is made for consoles as well so it has severe limitations same as <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org" target="_blank">Farming Simulator</a>.
</p>

<p>
Anyways just kind of waiting for my days third meal here watching the highway junction to the city and thinking how nasty it is to replace those dirt roads with some big proper road hierarchy stuff like six lane asphalt roads.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T06:04:00Z Alarm went off its time to eat, perfect timing I was just about to bite the bullet (no pun intended) and start to overhaul those roads, but first some encouragement from a meal <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T06:28:00Z Feeding time is over, okay last 4hrs 45min left on this day, lets make good use of it.
</p>

<p>
Seems like nothing happened in the city while I was eating, population dropped 1-2k that's all.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T06:54:00Z Loop around the main city area, or lets just say the "old city" area with six lane asphalt road done, also created one roundabout which sucked but works better than T intersection <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T07:41:00Z Uuh roundabout by the highway intersection was a shit show, haha I've been laughing at myself when making that atrocious hideous uuuuhh mess! <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T09:13:00Z Dead tired, going into the zombi mode even though still have one and a half hour of today left, it happens sometimes. Now I'm learning about roads and its a mess of grand magnitude heh, at least I'm learning something heh. But in a zombi mode its quite difficult and frustrating to get something good done.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T10:15:00Z Okay this is it, I am in full zombi mode and cant get roundabout done correctly, ONE MORE try and then I'm off to sleep... crossing fingers <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Got it almost working but it still grid-locked cars, oh well it was much better than what I've done before.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-30T10:43:00Z Saved game and shut down Cities Skylines, too tired, too late, I'm off to catch some Z's, nites.
