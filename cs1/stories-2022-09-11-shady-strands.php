	<h2>Stories 2022-09-11 Shady Strands Game-play</h2>

<p>
2022-09-11T06:55:00Z Started savegame on Shady Strands, all outside connections and natural resources, suitable area for building 57%, base theme: temperate.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: 81 tiles, camera position utility, cinematic camera extended v0.5.1, csl show more limits, enhanced outside connections view, extended game options, extra landscaping tools, first person camera, harmony v2.2, hide it, lifecycle rebalance revisited v1.6.4, optimize outside connections, precision engineering, random tree rotation, realistic population 2 v2.0.5, rebalanced industries, roundabout builder, TM:PE stable v11.6.6.3, transfermanager ce v1.8.10, transporttool v2.3.1, ultimate level of detail, unlimited oil and ore, unlimited soil. List updated: 2022-08-27T21:39:00Z
</p>

<p>
Buildable area 57% doesn't sound very good, almost half of it useless water, but lets hope this is playable terrain.
</p>

<p>
Seeing it the first time just made me sigh, yep its kind of like islands, water north and south, just makes you wonder what these terrain devs are thinking when making such useless heightmaps for Cities Skylines, this would be maybe OK in ArmA 3 but not in Cities Skylines. Oh well lets get this done quickly so we can move on to the next terrain.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of which, this is now the second last terrain in my stories terrains marathon game-play series <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles for use. TM:PE enabled disable de-spawning, advanced vehicle AI enabled, 50% dynamic lane selection, parking AI enabled more realistic parking. Transfer manager ce, goods delivery options warehouse first, reserve trucks for local transfers 20%, improved inter-warehouse transfers, import/export disabled allow import goods, services prefer local district services, death care/garbage improved all three, general disable dummy traffic, vehicle AI enable garbage and police.
</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
My starting setup.
</p>

</p>

<p>
First save game for Shady_Strands_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-11T07:04:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
So yeah, good morning. Just woke up and finished morning chores but didn't eat days first meal yet, was so excited about finishing this stories terrain game-play marathon that immediately launched the second last terrain. One more terrain to go after this.
</p>

<p>
In theory, a wishful fantasy, if everything goes really well, I could maybe finish this whole marathon tonight. Its doable to get two cities savegames to 100k within a day, I've done it few times, but definitely things must go well and not many mistakes can happen with traffic.
</p>

<p>
Lets try to get it done <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I cant imagine how my life will be after this over a month long Cities Skylines gaming marathon is over <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Did not create districts as they have no use for me now. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Shady_Strands_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
One thing at the time crasshopper... but I'm already dreaming about the last terrain being really nice temperate or boreal (although boreal has bad morning new fog lighting) so I could really enjoy it <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Really hoping it wont be some shit heightmap with european theme, ugh <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-11T07:27:00Z Tiny Town population 1.4k.

</p>

<p>
Saved game for Shady_Strands_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-11T07:39:00Z I went little too much on the arterial and collector roads so early in the beginning, now budget is very very low.
</p>

Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh. Ore industry specialization available.

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers. Two lane road with trees, this is my go-to local road, starting using it now and when time comes, will upgrade existing dirt roads with this one. Oil industry specialization available.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Shady_Strands_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-11T08:21:00Z Feeding time is over, back to Cities Skylines.
</p>

<p>
Why are all terrains so claustrophobic? Like this one. Every which way I try to expand its either; highway, railroad, water or mountain. Why cant we just have a big "american midwest" style flat country side terrain without any crap on it, is it too much to ask?
</p>

<p>
BTW all these Cities Skylines terrains feels extremely similar, also most of the .CRP file naming is done by the same person, perhaps its just some "mastering" dude who handled all the terrains who got sent to him, but I bet its the single one terrain developer in colossar order offices who made these, or at least most of them.
</p>
