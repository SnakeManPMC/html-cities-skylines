	<h2>Stories 2022-08-12 Roslyn Peninsula Game-play</h2>

<p>
2022-08-12T07:10:00Z Started savegame on Roslyn Peninsula, all outside connections, suitable area for building 54%, base theme: tropical.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: CargoHoldFix, ExtendedGameOptions, Harmony, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder, ShowIt.
</p>

<p>
I just mere moments ago finished previous terrain savegame and now I don't know what else to do, so lets start the next savegame. I'm a bit tired so we'll see if nap interrupts this game-play.
</p>

<p>
This is my starter setup before even unpausing the game for the first time.
</p>

<p>
First save game for Roslyn_Peninsula_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T07:20:00Z Now actually unpaused game the first time, lets play! <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

<p>
2022-08-12T07:26:00Z Little Hamlet population 460.
</p>

<p>
Here I'm doing 2x2 unit square residential zoning because the 1 or 2 households per big 4 x 4 unit zoning on real population addon.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T07:33:00Z Worthy Village population 900.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T07:41:00Z Tiny Town population 1.4k.
</p>

<p>
Okay now the first grid road layout I did is full with low density residential housing, using that 2 x 2 unit square setup, this hopefully maximized chances of getting 2 household buildings while still keeping the landscape "real estate" used half of the 4 x 4 unit square <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0748.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0748.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Next expansion for our zoning is done. I now pre-assigned those 2x2 unit squares for residential, when they have all (or almost all) filled with buildings then I just flag a box for the rest of them. Easy <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T08:07:00Z Boom Town population 2.4k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh. Enabled policy: parks and recreation.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Roslyn_Peninsula_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T08:13:00Z Now its my lunch time...
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T08:36:00Z Feeding time is over, back to building a city.
</p>

<p>
While I was eating nothing happened except residential demand went 100% heh.
</p>

<p>
New expansion grid is done, heh should be enough for a while again. Oh right here I just did full zoning again, it took way too long to fill in all the 2x2 units manually. We now have the money and can buy more terrain grid tiles so what difference does it make.
</p>

I hate connecting electricity, hmm should have expanded gradually towards north instead of doing all at once. OK, next time.
