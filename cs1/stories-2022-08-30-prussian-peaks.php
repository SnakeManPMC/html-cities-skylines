Uh oh this terrains name puts me off so bad, russian soviet commie scum and peaks, means hills mountains, just the thing you DONT want to see in Cities Skylines terrain heightmap <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Err when I got to in-game and saw the terrain the first time it was shocking, what kind of garbage is this?
</p>

<p>
Now if that was ArmA 3 terrain it would look awesome, all those mountain tops to hunt soviet commie scum and kill them, but as in Cities Skylines where you do buildings on large area, its just not going to work on such mountain hillsides <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Whole idea of my terrain savegame game-play playthroughs is a marathon, you play all of them through which makes the marathon, good terrains and bad terrains. But shit dude, there is a limit on "bad", this is unplayable garbage <img src="https://www.pmctactical.org/images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I am not going to do it, I simply wont.
</p>

<p>
So I'm saving this text file as web page now, use content manager to disable this russian soviet commie scum shit terrain and will mark the name into my local notes, maybe once every other PROPER terrain has been played through I could come back to this and see if it would be possible to somehow "hack" play to get some zoning done on any level ground you could find anywhere.
