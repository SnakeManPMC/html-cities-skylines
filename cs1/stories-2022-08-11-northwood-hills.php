<p>
2022-08-11T07:18:00Z Started savegame on Northwood Hills, all but ship outside connections, suitable area for building 72%, base theme: european.
</p>

<p>
Goal is to reach population 100k today as quick as possible while still enjoying the game.
</p>

<p>
Addons used: CargoHoldFix, ExtendedGameOptions, Harmony, RealPopRevisited, RoundaboutBuilder, ShowIt.
</p>

<p>
In this savegame start because of realpoprevisited addon I'm going to place 1x1 unit low density residential zones until big town milestone is reached. If you call that a cheat then so be it <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This is my starter grid before I've even unpaused the game the first time.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0724.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0724.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
First save game for Northwood_Hills_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
But uh oh I messed that up, forgot water tower and then on top of that it got placed without power, so it didn't work and then nobody had water heh. Only thing I could hope is that the first milestone kicks in before anything "dies" <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
What a newbie mistake, well this will be fixed in my next game start.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0731.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0731.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-11T07:31:00Z Yup its not working, I need to reload my first savegame before this savegame even gets fully started, this is hilarious, hopefully I can even move/adjust the water tower in the save so I don't have to completely do a fresh start hah.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T07:33:00Z Savegame loaded and I managed to place water tower and connect it to the power network <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0734.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0734.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Here we go, not a restart but savegame load to correct minor fix <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
At this point all I could do is wait, I've thrown the dices in the air and there was nothing I could do now with negative budget other than to wait what happens ...
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T07:38:00Z Little Hamlet population 420.
</p>

<p>
We made it! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Those 1x1 unit square zone residential buildings looks so silly.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0740.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0740.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-11T07:44:00Z Worthy Village population 850.
</p>

<p>
Ready for more commercial zones.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0748.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0748.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-11T07:49:00Z Tiny Town population 1.3k.
</p>

<p>
Yikes! We got power generating building in fire!
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0753.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0753.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Luckily our fire department was on point and extinquished the fire <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Come on city, grow, GROW! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0756.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0756.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-11T07:59:00Z Boom Town population 2.2k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh.
</p>

<p>
Bus route is in, reduced capacity before we get more folks.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0807.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0807.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Uh man, this feels super slow start again, dunno if I'm doing something wrong but it takes forever for population to increase. But no worries, we'll get there.
</p>

<p>
Well bus route got busy fast, at least one stop by the commercial zone is already over hundred people waiting for buses there.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0811.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0811.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I find this transportation thing quite faschinating, back in the old DOS days I played Ports Of Call ship company game and loved it, making bus and metro networks in Cities Skylines is not the same, but similar, in a way more complex too. Just very very interesting to me, I love watching especially metros hauling people around <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Stepping my park game up.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0821.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0821.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Its been said that RCI commercial is not really only commercial demand but "fun" entertainment demand, it can be either commercial zoning OR parks and other entertainment.
</p>

<p>
I judge if we need more commercial zoning by checking out buildings for "jobs available" number, if those are high or lets say many of them are NON zero, then there is no need to zone more commercial.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T08:33:00Z Uuh this next milestone wait was a long one. Felt really boring at this point... and while I was typing this paragraph / timestamp, guess what popped up in the background? Yes you guessed correctly:
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T08:34:00Z Busy Town population 4.4k.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Browsed through several commercial buildings and they were 0 jobs available, only few were 1 job available, didn't see 2 or more so I went and zoned in some more commercial.
</p>

<p>
City keeps growing, even though it LOOKS busy there is still plenty of empty property lots for people to move in and build a house, so I'm not going to zone in more residential yet.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0842.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0842.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-11T09:11:00Z Big Town population 7k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant and university are now available.
</p>

<p>
I have to say I am disappointed by the progress in this savegame, dunno what is done wrong, feels like takes forever to gain a bit of population.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0913.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T0913.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-11T09:13:00Z Now its my cooking food and eating break, so will let game run in 3x speed after taking a savegame for safety, while I'm eating.
</p>

<p>
After cooking food (but not eating yet), I added bunch of high density residential zoning, am I fucking blind of what, I did not notice they became available so kind of disregard that "progress" paragraph before as I had high density zoning already available, dumb ass. OK it must have been lack of nutrition <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T09:44:00Z pop 9.5k, I clicked ok.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T10:03:00Z Feeding time over, back to building this city.
</p>

<p>
While I was away from keyboard, you could sum it up that my city burnt down. First there was a water issue, I was using water towers which were within the industrial zone pollution range and now water supply got polluted, people started to get sick and ground across the neighborhoods polluted by the water. Then if this was not bad enough, we have a forest fire started by industrial building and that burnt huge swath of area.
</p>

<p>
Overall the damage was severe, shit got really out of hand while I was eating <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now honestly I am not sure why would I continue in this scorched earth policy land because I was not here, was not able to fix anything because I didn't even see anything. So I'm going to exit game and reload the last save I did just before leaving, like none of this ever happened.
</p>

<p>
This is also lesson for my future eating breaks, always save game before leaving the game running alone, make sure there is enough electricity and water system, plenty of both, as bad things can happen if you are not here to catch them. Preventive measures.
</p>

<p>
Lesson learned, wont be doing that mistake ever again.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T10:08:00Z And now, off to restart the game and reload last save.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T10:14:00Z Last savegame loaded. We continue, lets first fix the prophecy of water pollution and also get fire department helicopter depot <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Both water intake and sewage has been fixed.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T1019.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T1019.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Fire department helicopter depots have been bought and see on the top-right corner we even have fire watch tower too. So the ravaging forest fire issue is fixed.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T1022.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T1022.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
There was not really an garbage disposal issue, but now its prevented to happen.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T1024.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-11T1024.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

2022-08-11T12:54:00Z Losing motivation to play, I need to take a break, just want to chill rest of the day watching TV and doing other computer chores I've neglected lately. Hopefully return to this tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-11T12:55:00Z Saved game and shut down Cities Skylines, goodbye for today.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T00:39:00Z New city building day has started. Yesterdays "rest of the day off" was nice and relaxing, as I was hoping it got me the energy needed to get back into it with enthusiasm today.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to move PMC Industrial 1 district to another location and add farming, forestry, oil and ore too, but not sure if that is too much work, it would be mere hours before I would increase 65k population as it is now to the goal.
</p>

<p>
PMC Farming 1 district created (as generic zoning farming area, no industry building things used).
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0055.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0055.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Was adding these farming and forestry industrial areas while noticed population had dropped down to 61k, hmm looks like death wave has hit our city. Okay nothing can be done with that without an addon so yeah.
</p>

<p>
Was creating stuff in normal speed, decided to pause game when doing long periods of work in top-down view mode completely ignoring rest of the city, its almost like me not even playing the game as I cannot monitor what happens elsehwere when focusing on one specific 2D top-down point.
</p>

<p>
Farming and forestry districts are in.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0110.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0110.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Put heavy vehicle ban on PMC Residential 2 district, made sure the arterial roads are not included so heavy vehicles can still drive around it on those six lane roads.
</p>

<p>
Oh my look at that death wave.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0125.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0125.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Cargo train terminal for the big farming and forestry industry area, lets get that cargo moving <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0130.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0130.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Keeping busy at the PMC Forestry 1 district as well.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0137.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0137.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T01:45:00Z Its time for days first meal, checked for electricity and water supply, all good, saved game and let game run on 3x speed while I'm eating.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T02:10:00Z Feeding time over, back to city building.
</p>

<p>
Had a real problems connecting highway to my collector industrial road, tried roundabout but just got traffic jam, then ended up just not doing the connection.
</p>

<p>
PMC Oil 1 and PMC Ore 1 districts created with all included, now just need to unpause the game to see what I forgot to add <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0413.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0413.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
This oil and ore industrial part of the city became right away really busy, look at all that traffic.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0419.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0419.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Seems to be starting up pretty nicely, now we just need bunch of folks move in <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0507.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0507.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Purchased all the terrain grid tiles, now we have room to breathe.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0528.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0528.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

Saved game and will let it run for a while to settle down a bit.
</p>

<p>
Expansion to ore district.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0548.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0548.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Troublesome traffic. The more industry, the more traffic. Problem.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0600.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0600.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
What kind of a beast have I created again... <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0603.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0603.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-08-12T06:13:00Z Was adding new stuff and didn't even notice, we reached our goal 100k population! Yeah! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Smiley :mrgreen:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0614.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-12T0614.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Another terrain savegame finished or at least goal met, now this savegame will be archived and its available in future date if this terrain is interesting or perhaps I learn some new city design skills and I want to fix this city, for example that traffic is atrociously bad now heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-12T06:16:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, we are done here <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
