</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T13:04:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T13:12:00Z Little Hamlet population 440.
</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial. Purchased elementary school and landfill site.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T13:21:00Z Worthy Village population 850.
</p>

<p>
Didn't create districts. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Snowy_Coast_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T13:23:00Z Restored budget to 100% normal as I need to take a restroom break, cant babysit that budget game heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T13:30:00Z Tiny Town population 1.3k.
</p>

<p>
Uh oh, came back to computer and this milestone screen was up, but on the background I saw bunch of abandoned buildings with no power icons, hum did I actually ran out of power this quickly.
</p>

<p>
Apparently I did, had to purchase coal power plant to fix the situation.
</p>

<p>
Replaced placeholder dirt road arterial and collectors with proper six and four lane asphalt roads. Replaced industrial areas roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on. Created PMC Ore 1 and PMC Oil 1 districts for the industry areas even though those specializations are not available yet in this milestone, they'll come soon and then I'm ready to build.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Snowy_Coast_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T13:47:00Z Boom Town population 2.4k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh. Ore industry specialization available, so I selected that for PMC Ore 1 district.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T14:22:00Z Busy Town population 4.4k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers. Oil industry specialization available, so I set it to PMC Oil 1 district and zoned industy, too bad we have no demand currently.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Snowy_Coast_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T14:31:00Z Specialized industry started coming up, nice. Hopefully this reduces outside connections vehicle traffic a little bit, assuming we can manage to not import any ore and oil.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T15:05:00Z Big Town population 7k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant, intercity bus, university and large warehouse are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T15:17:00Z Small City population 9k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train terminal, train station (passengers!) and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T15:38:00Z Created cargo train terminal.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T15:43:00Z Big City population 15k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T16:04:00Z Grand City population 18k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T16:58:00Z Cleared traffic using TM:PE as it was 10% gridlocked, it was real bad, caused by industrial area, those oil and ore districts. I cut it back twice but gridlock continued. Decided to just clear traffic and see what happens. I very VERY rarely clear traffic. This was one of those times.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T17:14:00Z Deleted all the zoning for industrial, except south side of the highway. Brutal, huh.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T1715.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-05T1715.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
That obviously solved the traffic issue, however now we have very little industry and commercial hehe. Now I'm going to slowly one by one return the zoning and see how traffic picks up...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T17:42:00Z Capital City population 28k.
</p>

<p>
Passenger and cargo harbor is now available, passenger is a must have for incoming citizens.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T18:02:00Z Colossal City population 40k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T18:52:00Z Metropolis population 60k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T19:17:00Z Megalopolis population 70k.
</p>

<p>
Last milestone done. I'm dead tired, snoozing off any moment now... still struggling with traffic gridlock, uuh...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-05T19:41:00Z Time to call it a night, full zombi mode on, cant keep eyes open, nites.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T04:55:00Z New Cities Skylines building day has started, just finished a big daily morning computer chores, had to pay PMC web site domains and hosting fees, ugh. Now starting Cities Skylines and loading this savegame, going to let it run 3x time acceleration speed while I eat days first meal, hopefully we gain some stability and population.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T05:24:00Z Feeding time is over, back to Cities Skylines, lets finish this terrain!
</p>

<p>
Even though I loath these garbage WINTER terrains I am extremely enthusiastic and motivated now to finish this and the last savegame for these crap terrains, I want to get them done so I can focus to enjoy the last remaining normal non DLC (I think?) terrain game-plays <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So lets get to it, I have 15hrs left in this day, hooyah! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Population is now 87.8k which increased maybe thousand or two during my feeding break, time to add more high density residential.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T05:35:00Z Death blow expansion road grid and water pipes has been done, now its just matter of time when I zone small two 4 x 4 unit rows at once and let the build. I don't like to do the massive blob zoning as I believe it might cause some game "choking on data" issues so to speak. One row at the time, this way I can also control and check when service buildings need to be put down, for example you cant tell when schools are full.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T05:58:00Z We have reached 100k population, yeah! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T05:59:00Z Time to say goodbye to another WINTER terrain. Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, bye bitch.
</p>

<p>
When editing this story text realized I only took two screenshots heh, good, saves web server SSD space <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
