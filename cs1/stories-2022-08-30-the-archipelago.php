Uh oh another piece of shit terrain, I just finished trying to start a savegame for "Prussian Peaks" terrain which was unusable heightmap with huge ArmA 3 alike mountains, now we get archipelago which is dozens of tiny islands, seriously? <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

<p>
Oh hell no <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
Why? All I'm asking is, why... why people do shit terrains like this?
</p>

<p>
Since this is second unusable terrain in some DLC (no idea which, cant recognize the logo), I wonder if the next ones are as shitty as this one, maybe I need to skip all the terrains of this particular DLC.
</p>

<p>
So saving this stump of a text with one depressing 2D top-down screenshot to archives to remind me how horrible terrain this is. I can pretty much say outright that its not even possible to create 100k population city in this shitty terrain.

2022-08-30T19:25:00Z Exited to main menu and in content manager disabled the archipelago crap.
