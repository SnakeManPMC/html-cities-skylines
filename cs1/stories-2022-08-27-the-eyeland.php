<p>
In this terrain savegame I'm going to use extra landscaping tools to create good natural resources for farming, forestry, oil and ore where I need them and create those specialized zoned industry (no DLC).
</p>

<p>
Oh shit this is horrible looking islands terrain. Oh well lets see if we can get to 100k population as fast as possible <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open all terrain grid tiles to be used.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
For some reason extra landscaping tool was UNABLE to paint fertile land properly, it did a little bit but it was "not working". Sucks. You had to first erase ore and oil, but there was nothing with forest as guess it comes from the tree objects. I tried deleting bunch of them but still a no go.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-27T23:28:00Z Busy Town population 4.6k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for The_Eyeland_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
Had to google extra landscaping tools fertile land, the tool cant suck that bad where you cannot paint farmland correctly... Found info that there is some terrain creation image with RGB color channels where you paint forest, if terrain dev is doing forest this way then fertile land painting brush is never going to work. Well that sucks. Oh well guess I'll build my proper farmland zoned industry a bit more to the north lateron.
</p>

<p>
Painted oil terrain type down and then created quick PMC Oil 1 district with specialized industry aka zoned industry.
</p>

<p>

2022-08-27T23:59:00Z Now its my lunch time, saved game and let it run 3x speed while I eat, hopefully nothing breaks.

</p>

<p>
Should probably arrange some sort of mass transit thingy, but nah, lazy.. <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T03:24:00Z PMC Oil 1 industrial district and others too were full of raw materials or products, they were saying "not enough buyers for products", warehouses were full, for example I have THREE large 750 ton warehouses full of shit right now. So I'm testing with PMC Oil 1 district now to set its large warehouse in transfer manager ce to allow outside connection export. Immediately semi-trucks started to deliver oil products to outside connection aka "exporting oil products".
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0327.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0327.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T03:28:00Z Metropolis population 50k.
</p>

<p>
Managed to get all "not enough buyers for products" issues resolved, not exactly sure what did it, I only did whats said above, maybe it was an cascade effect like traffic which can cause completely unrelated issues. Like oil district has choking up because cant sell stuff and the... well dunno, fuck I don't know heheh. Anyways, oil is now exporting and some reason all industry areas are A-OK.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0344.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0344.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
PMC Farming 2 zoned industry district is coming up, lets make some jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0410.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0410.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T04:24:00Z Megalopolis population 65k.
</p>

<p>
Last milestone done, now we just go after the population goal.
</p>

<p>
Whoah, what have I done again, traffic jam, while it does flow... percentage is quite low and that red is shockingly long towards to the terrain edges <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0444.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0444.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Hmm and I thought to have kept my industry and commercial buildings in check, hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
Found one culprit of our slow deliveries, this was a huge bottle neck as there was bad lane selections, AI got confused with them and in three lane highway only used one lane in that short segment, now they use three again and we are rolling, fast.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0448.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0448.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T04:58:00Z Saved game and will let things settle down a bit over time, the delivery truck traffic is pretty intense but not yet "traffic jam". I'm going to grab a bite to eat while things are running by themselves.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T05:26:00Z Feeding time is over, back to city things.
</p>

<p>
Well during away time things actually got worse, traffic was on one lane in the long arterial road and it was bumper to bumper, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T05:43:00Z Created passenger ship harbor, this is good for the people who are moving into the city.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Ahoy matey! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0554.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0554.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Was wondering why are our large warehouses full 750 tons of commercial zone goods and many of the commercial buildings are importing goods from outside connection, so I did "map wide" transfer manager ce config to disallow outside connect imports on "commercial type" buildings. Lets see if our warehouses and generic industry runs out of goods now, if it even works.
</p>

<p>
Transfer Manager CE, options for general import, disabled for goods. Now lets see if this helps our commercial buildings to only use local source for goods products.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0650.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0650.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T07:36:00Z Whoah was still investigating and learning about transfer manager ce outside connections import blocking, when noticed that hey 103k population already! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah we are done here heh.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0736.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-08-28T0736.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-08-28T07:37:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, time to relax before bed time.
