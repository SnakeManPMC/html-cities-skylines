</p>

<p>
Ahh yes back to normal regular non-WINTER terrains! Whohoo! I love it! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Smiley :mrgreen:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Took an overview look and this terrain is fine, can easily build 100k population city here, its not completely flat and water-less but its just fine.
</p>

<p>
First used 81 tiles addon to open up all terrain grid tiles for use. TM:PE enabled disable de-spawning, advanced vehicle AI enabled, 50% dynamic lane selection, parking AI enabled more realistic parking. Transfer manager ce, goods delivery options warehouse first, reserve trucks for local transfers 20%, improved inter-warehouse transfers, import/export disabled allow import goods, services prefer local district services, death care/garbage improved all three, general disable dummy traffic, vehicle AI enable garbage and police.
</p>

<p>
Turned roads, electric and water budget to 50%, we need to save money.
</p>

<p>
Starter setup for this terrain.
</p>

</p>

<p>
First save game for Diamond_Coast_1 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T06:39:00Z Unpaused the game, lets start this thing.
</p>

<p>
Felt really great, this is now the first terrain on the "non DLC" terrains list, I assume that's what they are as they have no DLC affiliated icon on the new game terrain selector menu. Once these few remaining terrains are done, then my massive over a month long terrain savegame marathon game-play madness is over <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T06:47:00Z Little Hamlet population 500.
</p>

<p>
Turned on taxes to 12% for industrial, low density residential and commercial. Purchased elementary school and landfill site.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T06:55:00Z Worthy Village population 1k.
</p>

<p>
Decided not to create districts, kind of got used to it with those shitty WINTER terrains that technically you don't need to create districts, kinda. Placed fire station, police station and health clinic.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Diamond_Coast_2 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T07:05:00Z Tiny Town population 1.6k.
</p>

<p>
Replaced placeholder dirt road arterial and collectors with proper six and four lane asphalt roads. Replaced industrial areas roads with industry road type (small for local and medium for collector). Decided not to place warehouse for goods. Started to use two lane asphalt roads for residential areas from now on.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Diamond_Coast_3 file name.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T07:21:00Z Boom Town population 2.6k.
</p>

<p>
Cemetery and bus depot became available in this milestone, cemetery is essential for life heh. Ore industry specialization available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T07:30:00Z Increased budget to 100% which is the normal level. City is growing.
</p>

<p>
Had to make a real wonky highway outside connection link with my arterial road because the author is terrain did not use the standard proper intersection, it was some wonky hand made wobbly one which did not fit properly. Oh well no big deal, later I'll replace it with the big cloverleaf anyways.
</p>

<p>
City is expanding, another low density residential zone other side of the four lane collector road.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0744.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0744.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Now I've changed to zone around all local roads as previously I only zoned "inside road grid" leaving the outside road edge which I kind of considered "naked against the world" heh without zoning. Dunno how I feel about it, but technically it makes sense to zone all free unit unit squares, of course I wont zone on collector or arterial road because its so bad with commercial deliveries etc its better to stay away from those.
</p>

<p>
Also I'm zoning from inside out, naturally growing the city one row or block at the time, "leading the electric connection" so to speak. It feels more natural and involved like this, as opposite of zoning massive blobs and then go off do something else. You maintain better control, meaning that once each row is done you have all the possibilities to place service buildings etc if they are required. If you mass blob zone gazillion units / units, then when you suddenly need to place a service building, metro, etc, then you must demolish already setup buildings which is against everything I believe in such "creating game" <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T07:58:00Z I cannot describe in words how good I feel now being back in normal terrain type after SUFFERING through those garbage piece of shit WINTER terrains for days and days, almost felt like is the horror ever going to end, but it finally did, today. Now I'm enjoying so much of the greenery in regular terrain. This one is tropical so its not my favorite but still awesome <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T08:02:00Z Busy Town population 5k.
</p>

<p>
Fire helicopter depot became available in this milestone, this is must have to any large city, when you have traffic jams and fires, helicopters are a life savers. Two lane road with trees, this is my go-to local road, starting using it now and when time comes, although wont be upgrading existing dirt roads. Oil industry specialization available, however I'm not setting that up at least for now.
</p>

<p>
Saved game for Diamond_Coast_4 file name which is the last of the four rotating file names.
</p>

<p>
A sligth traffic issue in our industrial and commercial area, hmm hmm. This is disappointing as I tried to be very cautious when zoning those heavy traffic buildings and I have hammered hardcore bus lines in here, but still there are so many private cars clogging up the roads.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0830.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0830.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Wonder if I should ban private cars in that industry area, we have bus routes and metros are coming soon, so why are you sons of bitches driving your own cars there.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T08:35:00Z We are all zoned out every road we currently have, now I gotta take a restroom break and will actually pause game for the duration because I don't want anything to go wrong heh, usually I never pause.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0835.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0835.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Then I used TM:PE to ban all private cars on this industry area. Wonder if there was a way to do it district wise, I don't recall there being in-game policy for it hmm.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T08:44:00Z Well that fixed traffic issue in industry area, traffic flow 91% now and hardly any red on the industry area, excellent. Dunno if there are any penalties somehow bad stuff happening because these bitches cant roll through the hood with their private cars, hope not.
</p>

<p>
Gave folks at the residential 3 area a bit more pedestrial walking paths to the low density commercial area.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0908.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0908.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Enjoy the walk.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T09:09:00Z Big Town population 7.5k.
</p>

<p>
High density zones, metro, incineration plant, intercity bus, university and large warehouse are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T09:37:00Z Small City population 10k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives us cargo train terminal, train station (passengers!) and two good policies. Activated small business enthusiast and big business benefactor policies.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T09:43:00Z Funny thing happened, our bus lines had way too many vehicles with very few passengers so I reduced them quite dramatically, best guess how many buses would be needed for specific lines. Well this caused funny bus mass transit heh.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0944.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0944.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
Created cargo train terminal for our industry area. Lets get those raw materials and goods hauling.
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0950.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T0950.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T10:12:00Z Been trying to decide how do I want to do metro. On my previous "anger towards winter" savegame I spammed straight line metros across the city in north south direction everywhere I could fit them. It was pretty sicko setup but man did those people love them, there was THOUSANDS of passengers every week or is it day the stats forgot already, anyways. That kind of straight line is easy to do, just scroll and place stuff, but hmm dunno if its realistic. I saw some real life reference photo of metro design and that city had straight lines across it too, that's where I kind of got the idea, usually I do loops.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm leaning towards never evolving loop, that I constantly add new areas to it when I develop the city. It requires a lot of money to re-construct the rail network plus back and forth annoyance for citizens as metro lines get destroyed and re-created often, but dunno.
</p>

<p>
Also been hesitant to start doing metro because budget has been so low, metro tracks are not cheap to place. Usually I don't start creating metro without several HUNDREDS of thousands budget.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T10:18:00Z Lunch break, had to pause game because electric and water is getting low, I just want to eat in peace without worrying about city burning down. Going to probably google couple of things I've been thinking as well while eating.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T10:54:00Z Feeding time is over, back to Cities Skylines.
</p>

<p>
Well metro loop is in, very basic, working.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T11:14:00Z Big City population 16k.
</p>

<p>
Crematorium, large water tower and advanced inland water treatment plant are now available.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T11:41:00Z Grand City population 20k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T12:21:00Z Capital City population 30k.
</p>

<p>
Passenger and cargo harbor is now available, passenger is a must have for incoming citizens.
</p>

<p>
Created cargo harbor, dunno why, not really needing it, but it was just so easy.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T13:07:00Z Colossal City population 42k.
</p>

<p>
This milestone gives nuclear power plant and cargo hub (ship + train terminal).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T13:57:00Z Metropolis population 60k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T14:01:00Z Bulldozed cargo harbor, it just caused problems. Oil power plant ordered oil delivery from the harbor, well the plant ran out of oil while the semi-truck tanker trailer was on its way. I have no idea why didn't the oil power plant order delivery from cargo train terminal which is few blocks away. Oh well problem sorted, harbor destroyed.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T14:55:00Z Made sure we have plenty of electric and water, then zoned bunch of offices and high density residential and now I'm going to do a chore, will take 20-30min or so, hopefully city wont burn down in the mean time heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T15:13:00Z Back and ... Megalopolis population 75k.
</p>

<p>
Alright chore done and now we achieved the last milestone as well. Now only few tens of thousands of population growth and we get to finish this.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T15:33:00Z Created second passenger train station, now all the way to the south where we are building our last high density residential zone.
</p>

<p>
Its working hehe.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T16:04:00Z Whoah! Population 100k, goals are met! Yeah buddy! <img src="../../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T1604.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Cities-Skylines-2022-09-06T1604.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Cities Skylines Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
It was fun playing again on normal regular terrain, glad to be back. Also with couple of hiccups I managed to avoid too many traffic problems, industrial commercial area settles into its own place pretty nicely.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-06T16:06:00Z Saved game and shutdown Cities Skylines, time to chill rest of the evening.
