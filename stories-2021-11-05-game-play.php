<b>2021-11-05</b> Third game-play.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-05T01:47:00Z Was watching unnamed tv show marathon on editing computers monitor (not from TV), so was really bored overall, thought to myself... why not switch to gaming computer, play Cities Skylines while watching unnamed tv show from the BenQ 24" 1080p second monitor... I mean it doesn't even diminish the release resolution and would be less boring for me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So here I am, installed Cities Skylines back and ready to continue watching tv show marathon heh...
</p>

<p>
2021-11-05T01:51:00Z Started Grand River terrain savegame.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-05T02:56:00Z Didn't write down the city growth here, I just sped with high speed expanding city constantly as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-05T03:09:00Z Took a lunch break, left game running at fast speed. I'm not overly caring here heh.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-05T03:36:00Z Feeding time over, back to not caring about this city <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
During the break city population did not grow at all, and nothing special happened. So it seems like if you do not grow zone sizes... nothing happens, there is hard limit per city square block zone area.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-05T04:22:00Z big city pop 17k.

</p>

<p>
2021-11-05T09:40:00Z situation stalled again a bit, population dropped to 65k, was bored, things were kind of whack-a-mole again. Decided to stop playing.
